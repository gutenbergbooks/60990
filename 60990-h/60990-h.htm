  <div class="center xlarge mt6 mb2"><b>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</b></div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT has been my endeavour to provide in this book a concise, yet
    sufficiently complete, account of the physical characters of the
    mineral species which find service in jewellery, and of the methods
    available for determining their principal physical constants to enable
    a reader, even if previously unacquainted with the subject, to have
    at hand all the information requisite for the sure identification of
    any cut stone which may be met with. For several reasons I have dealt
    somewhat more fully with the branches of science closely connected with
    the properties of crystallized matter than has been customary hitherto
    in even the most comprehensive books on precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> stones. Recent years
    have witnessed many changes in the jewellery world. Gem-stones are no
    longer entirely drawn from a few well-marked mineral species, which
    are, on the whole, easily distinguishable from one another, and it
    becomes increasingly difficult for even the most experienced eye to
    recognize a cut stone with unerring certainty. So long as the only
    confusion lay between precious stones and paste imitations an ordinary
    file was the solitary piece of apparatus required by the jeweller, but
    now recourse must be had to more discriminative tests, such as the
    refractive index or the specific gravity, the determination of which
    calls for a little knowledge and skill. Concurrently, a keener interest
    is being taken in the scientific aspect of gem-stones by the public at
    large, who are attracted to them mainly by æsthetic considerations.</p>

  <p>While the treatment has been kept as simple as possible, technical
    expressions, where necessary, have not been avoided, but their meanings
    have been explained, and it is hoped that their use will not prove
    stumbling-blocks to the novice. Unfamiliar words of this kind often
    give a forbidding air to a new subject, but they are used merely to
    avoid circumlocution, and not, like the incantations of a wizard, to
    veil the difficulties in still deeper gloom. For actual practical work
    the pages on the refractometer and its use and the method of heavy
    liquids for the determination of specific gravities, and the tables of
    physical constants at the end of the book, with occasional reference,
    in case of doubt, to the descriptions of the several species alone
    are required; other methods—such as the prismatic mode of measuring
    refractive indices, or the hydrostatic way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span> of finding specific
    gravities—which find a place in the ordinary curriculum of a physics
    course are described in their special application to gem-stones, but
    they are not so suitable for workshop practice. Since the scope of the
    book is confined mainly to the stones as they appear on the market,
    little has been said about their geological occurrence; the case of
    diamond, however, is of exceptional interest and has been more fully
    treated. The weights stated for the historical diamonds are those
    usually published, and are probably in many instances far from correct,
    but they serve to give an idea of the sizes of the stones; the English
    carat is the unit used, and the numbers must be increased by about 2½
    per cent. if the weights be expressed in metric carats. The prices
    quoted for the various species must only be regarded as approximate,
    since they may change from year to year, or even day to day, according
    to the state of trade and the whim of fashion.</p>

  <p>The diagram on <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a> and most of the crystal drawings were made
    by me. The remaining drawings are the work of Mr. H. H. Penton. He
    likewise prepared the coloured drawings of cut stones which appear
    on the three coloured plates, his models, with two exceptions, being
    selected from the cut specimens in the Mineral Collection of the
    British Museum by permission of the Trustees. Unfortunately, the
    difficulties that still beset the reproduction of pictures in colour
    have prevented full justice being done to the faithfulness of his
    brush. I highly appreciate the interest he took in the work, and the
    care and skill with which it was executed. My thanks are due to the
    De Beers Consolidated Mines Co. Ltd., and to Sir Henry A. Miers,
    F.R.S., Principal of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span> University of London, for the illustrations
    of the Kimberley and Wesselton diamond mines, and of the methods and
    apparatus employed in breaking up and concentrating the blue ground;
    to Messrs. I. J. Asscher &amp; Co. for the use of the photograph of the
    Cullinan diamond; to Mr. J. H. Steward for the loan of the block of the
    refractometer; and to Mr. H. W. Atkinson for the illustration of the
    diamond-sorting machine. My colleague, Mr. W. Campbell Smith, B.A., has
    most kindly read the proof-sheets, and has been of great assistance in
    many ways. I hope that, thanks to his invaluable help, the errors in
    the book which may have escaped notice will prove few in number and
    unimportant in character. To Mr. Edward Hopkins I owe an especial debt
    of gratitude for his cheerful readiness to assist me in any way in
    his power. He read both the manuscript and the proof-sheets, and the
    information with regard to the commercial and practical side of the
    subject was very largely supplied by him. He also placed at my service
    a large number of photographs, some of which—for instance, those
    illustrating the cutting of stones—he had specially taken for me, and
    he procured for me the jewellery designs shown on <a href="#Plate_IV">Plates IV and V</a>.</p>

  <p>If this book be found by those engaged in the jewellery trade helpful
    in their everyday work, and if it wakens in readers generally an
    appreciation of the variety of beautiful minerals suitable for gems,
    and an interest in the wondrous qualities of crystallized substances, I
    shall be more than satisfied.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">BEAUTY, durability, and rarity: such are the three cardinal virtues
    of a perfect gem-stone. Stones lacking any of them cannot aspire to
    a high place in the ranks of precious stones, although it does not
    necessarily follow that they are of no use for ornamental purposes. The
    case of pearl, which, though not properly included among gem-stones,
    being directly produced by living agency, yet holds an honoured place
    in jewellery, constitutes to some extent an exception, since its
    incontestable beauty atones for its comparative want of durability.</p>

  <p>That a gem-stone should be a delight to the eye is a truism that need
    not be laboured; for such is its whole <i xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i>. The members
    of the Mineral Kingdom that find service in jewellery may be divided
    into three groups, according as they are transparent, translucent,
    or opaque. Of these the first, which is by far the largest and the
    most important, may itself be further sub-divided into two sections:
    stones which are devoid of colour, and stones which are tinted. Among
    the former, diamond reigns supreme, since it alone possesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span> that
    marvellous ‘fire,’ oscillating with every movement from heavenly blue
    to glowing red, which is so highly esteemed and so much besought.
    Other stones, such as ‘fired’ zircon, white sapphire, white topaz, and
    rock-crystal, may dazzle with brilliancy of light reflected from the
    surface or emitted from the interior, but none of them, like diamond,
    glow with mysterious gleams. No hint of colour, save perhaps a trace
    of the blue of steel, can be tolerated in stones of this category;
    above all is a touch of the jaundice hue of yellow abhorred. It taxes
    all the skill of the lapidary to assure that the disposition of the
    facets be such as to reveal the full splendour of the stone. A coloured
    stone, on the other hand, depends for its attractiveness more upon its
    intrinsic hue than upon the manner of its cutting. The tint must not be
    too light or too dark in shade: a stone that has barely any colour has
    little interest, and one which is too dark appears almost opaque and
    black. The lapidary can to some extent remedy these defects by cutting
    the former deep and the latter shallow. In certain curious stones—for
    instance tourmaline—the transparency, and in others—such as ruby,
    sapphire, and one of the recent additions to the gem world, kunzite—the
    colour, varies considerably in different directions. The colours that
    are most admired—the fiery red of ruby, the royal blue of sapphire,
    the verdant green of emerald, and the golden yellow of topaz—are pure
    tints, and the absorption spectra corresponding to them are on the
    whole continuous and often restricted. They therefore retain the purity
    of their colour even in artificial light, though certain sapphires
    transmit a relatively larger amount of red,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> and consequently turn
    purple at night. Of the small group of translucent stones which pass
    light, but are not clear enough to be seen through, the most important
    is opal. It and certain others of the group owe their merit to the
    same optical effect as that characterizing soap-bubbles, tarnished
    steel, and so forth, and not to any intrinsic coloration. Another
    set of stones—moonstone and the star-stones—reflect light from the
    interior more or less regularly, but not in such a way as to produce
    a play of colour. The last group, which comprises opaque stones, has
    a single representative among ordinary gem-stones, namely, turquoise.
    In this case light is scattered and reflected from layers immediately
    contiguous to the surface, and the colour is due to the resulting
    absorption. The apparent darkness of a deep-coloured stone follows from
    a different cause: the light passing into the stone is wholly absorbed
    within it, and, since none is emitted, the stone appears black. The
    claims of turquoise are maintained by the blue variety; there is little
    demand for stones of a greenish tinge.</p>

  <p>It is evidently desirable that any stones used in jewellery should be
    able to resist the mechanical and chemical actions of everyday life. No
    one is anxious to replace jewels every few years, and the most valuable
    stones are expected to endure for all time. The mechanical abrasion
    is caused by the minute grains of sand that are contained in ordinary
    dust, and gem-stones should be at least as hard as they—a condition
    fulfilled by all the principal species with the exception of opal,
    turquoise, peridot, and demantoid. Since the beauty of the first named
    does not depend on the brilliancy of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> polish, scratches on the
    surface are not of much importance; further, all four are only slightly
    softer than sand. It may be noted that the softness of paste stones,
    apart from any objections that may be felt to the use of imitations,
    renders them unsuitable for jewellery purposes. The only stones that
    are likely to be chemically affected in the course of wear are those
    which are in the slightest degree porous. It is hazardous to immerse
    turquoises in liquids, even in water, lest the bluish green colour be
    oxidized to the despised yellowish hue. The risk of damage to opals,
    moonstones, and star-stones by the penetration of dirt or grease into
    the interior of the stones is less, but is not wholly negligible.
    Similar remarks apply with even greater force to pearls. Their charm,
    which is due to a peculiar surface-play of light, might be destroyed by
    contamination with grease, ink, or similar matter; they are, moreover,
    soft. For both reasons their use in rings is much to be deprecated.
    Nothing can be more unsightly than the dingy appearance of a pearl ring
    after a few years’ wear.</p>

  <p>It cannot be gainsaid that mankind prefers the rare to the beautiful,
    and what is within reach of all is lightly esteemed. It is for this
    reason that garnet and moonstone lie under a cloud. Purchasers can
    readily be found for a ‘Cape-ruby’ or an ‘olivine,’ but not for a
    garnet; garnets are so common, is the usual remark. Nevertheless,
    the stones mentioned are really garnets. If science succeeded in
    manufacturing diamonds at the cost of shillings instead of the pounds
    that are now asked for Nature’s products—not that such a prospect is at
    all probable or even feasible—we might expect them to vanish entirely
    from fashionable jewellery.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

  <p>A careful study of the showcases of the most extensive jewellery
    establishment brings to light the fact that, despite the apparent
    profusion, the number of different species represented is restricted.
    Diamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire, pearl, opal, turquoise, topaz,
    amethyst are all that are ordinarily asked for. Yet, as later pages
    will show, there are many others worthy of consideration; two among
    them—peridot and tourmaline—are, indeed, slowly becoming known. For
    the first five of the stones mentioned above, the demand is relatively
    steady, and varies absolutely only with the purchasing power of the
    world; but a lesser known stone may suddenly spring into prominence
    owing to the caprice of fashion or the preference of some great lady
    or leader of fashion. Not many years ago, for instance, violet was the
    favourite colour for ladies’ dresses, and consequently amethysts were
    much worn to match, but with the change of fashion they speedily sank
    to their former obscurity. Another stone may perhaps figure at some
    royal wedding; for a brief while it becomes the vogue, and afterwards
    is seldom seen.</p>

  <p>Except that diamond, ruby, emerald, and sapphire, and, we should add,
    pearl, may indisputably be considered to occupy the first rank, it is
    impossible to form the gem-stones in any strict order. Every generation
    sees some change. The value of a stone is after all merely what it will
    fetch in the open market, and its artistic merits may be a matter of
    opinion. The familiar aphorism,  <i xml:lang="la">de gustibus non est disputandum</i>, is a
    warning not to enlarge upon this point.</p>

    <div class="headingc">CRYSTALLINE FORM</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WITH the single exception of opal, the whole of the principal mineral
    species used in jewellery are distinguished from glass and similar
    substances by one fundamental difference: they are crystallized matter,
    and the atoms composing them are regularly arranged throughout the
    structure.</p>

  <p>The words crystal and glass are employed in science in senses differing
    considerably from those in popular use. The former of them is derived
    from the Greek word <span xml:lang="el">κρύος</span>, meaning ice, and was at one time
    used in that sense. For instance, the old fourteenth-century reading of
    Psalm cxlvii. 17, which appears in the authorized version as “He giveth
    his ice like morsels,” ran “He sendis his kristall as morcels.” It was
    also applied to the beautiful, lustrous quartz found among the eternal
    snows of the Alps, since, on account of their limpidity, these stones
    were supposed, as Pliny tells us, to consist of water congealed by the
    extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> cold of those regions; such at the present day is the ordinary
    meaning of the word. But, when early investigators discovered that a
    salt solution on evaporation left behind groups of slender glistening
    prisms, each very similar to the rest, they naturally—though, as we
    now know, wrongly—regarded them as representing yet another form
    of congealed water, and applied the same word to such substances.
    Subsequent research has shown that these salts, as well as mineral
    substances occurring with natural faces in nature, have in common the
    fundamental property of regularity of arrangement of the constituent
    atoms, and science therefore defines by the word crystal a substance in
    which the structure is uniform throughout, and all the similar atoms
    composing it are arranged with regard to the structure in a similar way.</p>

  <p>The other word is yet more familiar; it denotes the transparent,
    lustrous, hard, and brittle substance produced by the fusion of sand
    with soda or potash or both which fills our windows and serves a
    variety of useful purposes. Research has shown that glass, though
    apparently so uniform in character, has in reality no regularity of
    molecular arrangement. It is, in fact, a kind of mosaic of atoms,
    huddled together anyhow, but so irregular is its irregularity that
    it simulates perfect regularity. Science uses the word glass in this
    widened meaning. Two substances may, as a matter of fact, have the
    same chemical composition, and one be a crystal and the other a glass.
    For example, quartz, if heated to a high temperature, may be fused and
    converted into a glass. The difference in the two types of structure
    may be illustrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span> by a comparison between a regiment of soldiers
    drawn up on parade and an ordinary crowd of people.</p>

  <p>The crystalline form is a visible sign of the molecular arrangement,
    and is intimately associated with the directional physical properties,
    such as the optical characters, cleavage, etc. A study of it is not
    only of interest in itself, but also of great importance to the
    lapidary who wishes to cut a stone to the best advantage, and it is,
    moreover, of service in distinguishing stones when in the rough state.</p>

  <p>The development of natural faces on a crystal is far from being
    haphazard, but is governed by the condition that the angles between
    similar faces, whether on the same crystal or on different crystals,
    are equal, however varying may be the shapes and the relative sizes
    of the faces (Fig. 1), and by the tendency of the faces bounding
    the crystal to fall into series with parallel edges, such series
    being termed zones. Each species has a characteristic type of
    crystallization, which may be referred to one of the following six
    systems:—</p>

  <p>1. <i>Cubic.</i>—Crystals in this system can be referred to three edges,
    which are mutually at right angles, and in which the directional
    characters are identical in value. These principal edges are known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
    as axes. Some typical forms are the cube (Fig. 2), characteristic
    of fluor; the octahedron (Fig. 3), characteristic of diamond and
    spinel; the dodecahedron (Fig. 4), characteristic of garnet; and the
    triakisoctahedron, or three-faced octahedron (Fig. 5).</p>

  <p>Crystals belonging to this system are doubly refractive and uniaxial,
    <i>i.e.</i> they have one direction of single refraction (cf. <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>), which
    is parallel to the unequal edge of the three mentioned above.</p>

      sets of Axes in the Hexagonal System.</div>
  </div>

  <p>3. <i>Hexagonal.</i>—Such crystals can be referred alternatively either
    to a set of three axes, <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, <i>Z</i> (Fig. 7), which lie in a plane
    perpendicular to a fourth, <i>H</i>, and are mutually inclined at angles of
    60°, or to a set of three, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, which are not at right angles
    as in the cubic system, but in which the directional characters are
    identical. The fourth axis in the first arrangement is equally inclined
    to each in the second set of axes. Many important species crystallize
    in this system—corundum (sapphire, ruby), beryl (emerald, aquamarine),
    tourmaline, quartz, and phenakite. The crystals usually display a
    six-sided prism, terminated by a single face, <i>c</i>, perpendicular to the
    edge of the prism <i>m</i> (Fig. 8), <i>e.g.</i> emerald, or by six or twelve
    inclined faces, <i>p</i> (Fig. 9), <i>e.g.</i> quartz, crystals of which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> so
    constant in form as to be the most familiar in the Mineral Kingdom.
    Tourmaline crystals (Fig. 10) are peculiar because of the fact that
    often one end is obviously to the eye flatter than the other.</p>

  <p>Crystals belonging to this system are also doubly refractive and
    uniaxial, the direction of single refraction being parallel to the
    fourth axis mentioned above, and therefore also parallel to the prism
    edge. Hence deeply coloured tourmaline, which strongly absorbs the
    ordinary ray, must be cut with the table-facet parallel to the edge of
    the prism.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Orthorhombic.</i>—Such crystals can be referred to three axes, which
    are mutually at right angles, but in which each of the directional
    characters are different. The crystals are usually prismatic in shape,
    one of the axes being parallel to the prism edge. Topaz, peridot, and
    chrysoberyl are the most important species crystallizing in this system.</p>

  <p>Crystals belonging to this system are doubly refractive and biaxial,
    <i>i.e.</i> they have two directions of single refraction (cf. p. 45). The
    three axes <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> (Fig. 11) are parallel respectively to the two
    bisectrices of the directions of single refraction, and the direction
    perpendicular to the plane containing those directions.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Monoclinic.</i>—Such crystals can be referred to three axes, one
    of which is at right angles to the other two, which are, however,
    themselves not at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> right angles. Spodumene (kunzite) and some moonstone
    crystallize in this system.</p>

  <p>Crystals belonging to this system are doubly refractive and biaxial,
    but in this case the first axis alone is parallel to one of the
    principal optical directions.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Triclinic.</i>—Such crystals have no edges at right angles, and the
    optical characters are not immediately related to the crystalline form.
    Some moonstone crystallizes in this system.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Twinned<br />Octahedron.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Crystals are often not single separate individuals. For instance,
    diamond and spinel are found in flat triangular crystals with their
    girdles cleft at the corners (Fig. 12). Each of such crystals is
    really composed of portions of two similar octahedra, which are placed
    together in such a way that each is a reflection of the other. Such
    composite crystals are called twins or macles. Sometimes the twinning
    is repeated, and the individuals may be so minute as to call for a
    microscope for their perception.</p>

  <p>A composite structure may also result from the conjunction of
    numberless minute individuals without any definite orientation, as in
    the case of chalcedony and agate. So by supposing the individuals to
    become infinitesimally small, we pass to a glass-like substance.</p>

  <p>It is often a peculiarity of crystals of a species to display a typical
    combination of natural faces. Such a combination is known as the habit
    of the species, and is often of service for the purpose of identifying
    stones before they are cut. Thus, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> habit of diamond and spinel is
    an octahedron, often twinned, of garnet a dodecahedron, of emerald a
    flat-ended hexagonal prism, and so on.</p>

  <p>It is one of the most interesting and remarkable features connected
    with crystallization that the composition and the physical
    characters—for instance, the refractive indices and specific
    gravity—may, without any serious disturbance of the molecular
    arrangement, vary considerably owing to the more or less complete
    replacement of one element by another closely allied to it. That is
    the cause of the range of the physical characters which has been
    observed in such species as tourmaline, peridot, spinel, etc. The
    principal replacements in the case of the gem-stones are ferric oxide,
    Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, by alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and ferrous oxide, FeO, by
    magnesia, MgO.</p>

  <p>A list of the principal gem-stones, arranged by their chemical
    composition, is given in <a href="#TABLE_I">Table I</a> at the end of the book.</p>

    <div class="headingc">REFLECTION, REFRACTION, AND DISPERSION</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT is obvious that, since a stone suitable for ornamental use must
    appeal to the eye, its most important characters are those which depend
    upon light; indeed, the whole art of the lapidary consists in shaping
    it in such a way as to show these qualities to the best advantage. To
    understand why certain forms are given to a cut stone, it is essential
    for us to ascertain what becomes of the light which falls upon the
    surface of the stone; further, we shall find that the action of a
    stone upon light is of very great help in distinguishing the different
    species of gem-stones. The phenomena displayed by light which impinges
    upon the surface separating two media<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are very similar in character,
    whatever be the nature of the media.</p>

  <p>Ordinary experience with a plane mirror tells us that, when light is
    returned, or reflected, as it is usually termed, from a plane or flat
    surface, there is no alteration in the size of objects viewed in this
    way, but that the right and the left hands are interchanged: our right
    hand becomes the left hand in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>our reflection in the mirror. We notice,
    further, that our reflection is apparently just as far distant from the
    mirror on the farther side as we are on this side. In Fig. 13 <i>MM´</i>
    is a section of the mirror, and <i>O´</i> is the image of the hand <i>O</i> as
    seen in the mirror. Light from <i>O</i> reaches the eye <i>E</i> by way of <i>m</i>,
    but it appears to come from <i>O´</i>. Since <i>OO´</i> is perpendicular to the
    mirror, and <i>O</i> and <i>O´</i> lie at equal distances from it, it follows
    from elementary geometry that the angle <i>i´</i>, which the reflected ray
    makes with <i>mn</i>, the normal to the mirror, is equal to <i>i</i>, the angle
    which the incident ray makes with the same direction.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p015.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="351" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>—Reflection at a Plane Mirror.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Again, everyday experience tells us that the case is less simple when
    light actually crosses the bounding surface and passes into the other
    medium. Thus, if we look down into a bath filled with water, the
    bottom of the bath appears to have been raised up, and a stick plunged
    into the water seems to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> bent just at the surface, except in the
    particular case when it is perfectly upright. Since the stick itself
    has not been bent, light evidently suffers some change in direction as
    it passes into the water or emerges therefrom. The passage of light
    from one medium to another was studied by Snell in the seventeenth
    century, and he enunciated the following laws:—</p>

  <p>1. The refracted ray lies in the plane containing the incident ray and
    the normal to the plane surface separating the two media.</p>

  <p>It will be noticed that the reflected ray obeys this law also.</p>

  <p>2. The angle <i>r</i>, which the refracted ray makes with the normal, is
    related to the angle <i>i</i>, which the incident ray makes with the same
    direction, by the equation</p>

  <p class="center"><i>n</i> sin <i>i</i> = <i>n´</i> sin <i>r</i>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>a</i>)</p>

  <p class="noindent">where <i>n</i> and <i>n´</i> are constants for the two media which are known as
    the indices of refraction, or the refractive indices.</p>

  <p>This simple trigonometrical relation may be expressed in geometrical
    language. Suppose we cut a plane section through the two media at right
    angles to the bounding plane, which then appears as a straight line,
    <i>SOS´</i> (Fig. 14), and suppose that <i>IO</i> represents the direction of
    the incident ray; then Snell’s first law tells us that the refracted
    ray <i>OR</i> will also lie in this plane. Draw the normal <i>NON´</i>, and with
    centre <i>O</i> and any radius describe a circle intersecting the incident
    and refracted rays in the points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> respectively; let drop
    perpendiculars <i>ac</i> and <i>bd</i> on to the normal <i>NON´</i>. Then we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
    <i>n.ac = n´.bd</i>, whence we see that if <i>n</i> be greater than <i>n´</i>, <i>ac</i>
    is less than <i>bd</i>, and therefore when light passes from one medium
    into another which is less optically dense, in its passage across the
    boundary it is bent, or refracted, away from the normal.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p017.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="342" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>—Refraction across a Plane Surface.</div>
  </div>

  <p>We see, then, that when light falls on the boundary of two different
    media, some is reflected in the first and some is refracted into the
    second medium. The relative amounts of light reflected and refracted
    depend on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the
    media. We shall return to this point when we come to consider the
    lustre of stones.</p>

  <p>We will proceed to consider the course of rays at different angles of
    incidence when light passes out from a medium into one less dense—for
    instance, from water into air. Corresponding to light with a small
    angle of incidence such as <i>I<sub>1</sub>O</i> (Fig. 15), some of it is reflected
    in the direction <i>OI´<sub>1</sub></i>
    and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> remainder is refracted out in the
    direction <i>OR<sub>1</sub></i>. Similarly, for the ray <i>I<sub>2</sub>O</i> some is reflected
    along <i>OI´<sub>2</sub></i> and some refracted along <i>OR<sub>2</sub></i>. Since, in the case
    we have taken, the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of
    incidence, the refracted ray corresponding to some incident, ray
    <i>I<sub>c</sub>O</i> will graze the bounding surface, and corresponding to a
    ray beyond it, such as <i>I<sub>3</sub>O</i>, which has a still greater angle of
    incidence, there is no refracted ray, and all the light is wholly
    or totally reflected within the dense medium. The critical angle
    <i>I<sub>c</sub>ON</i>, which is called the angle of total-reflection, is very
    simply related to the refractive indices of the two media; for, since
    <i>r</i> is now a right angle, sin <i>r</i> = <span class="smcap">1</span>, and equation (<i>a</i>)
    becomes</p>

  <p class="center"><i>n</i> sin <i>i</i> = <i>n´</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(<i>b</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Hence, if the angle of total-reflection is measured and one of the
    indices is known, the other can easily be calculated.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p018.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="467" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>—Total-Reflection.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The phenomenon of total-reflection may be appreciated if we hold a
    glass of water above our head, and view the light of a lamp on a table
    reflected from the under surface of the water. This reflection is
    incomparably more brilliant than that given by the upper surface.</p>

  <p>The refractive index of air is taken as unity; strictly, it is that of
    a vacuum, but the difference is too small to be appreciated even in
    very delicate work. Every substance has different indices for light
    of different colour, and it is customary to take as the standard the
    yellow light of a sodium flame. This happens to be the colour to
    which our eyes are most sensitive, and a flame of this kind is easily
    prepared by volatilizing a little bicarbonate of soda in the flame of
    a bunsen burner. A survey of <a href="#TABLE_III">Table III</a> at the end of the book shows
    clearly how valuable a measurement of the refractive index is for
    determining the species to which a cut stone belongs. The values found
    for different specimens of the species do in cases vary considerably
    owing to the great latitude possible in the chemical constitution
    due to the isomorphous replacement of one element by another. Some
    variation in the index may even occur in different directions within
    the same stone; it results from the remarkable property of splitting up
    a beam of light into two beams, which is possessed by many crystallized
    substances. This forms the subject of a later chapter.</p>

  <p>Upon the fact that the refractive index of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> substance varies for
    light of different colours depends such familiar phenomena as the
    splendour of the rainbow and the ‘fire’ of the diamond. When white
    light is refracted into a stone it no longer remains white, but is
    split up into a spectrum. Except in certain anomalous substances the
    refractive index increases progressively as the wave-length of the
    light decreases, and consequently a normal spectrum is violet at one
    end and passes through green and yellow to red at the other end. The
    width of the spectrum, which may be measured by the difference between
    the refractive indices for the extreme red and violet rays, also
    varies, though on the whole it increases with the refractive index. It
    is the dispersion, as this difference is termed, that determines the
    ‘fire’—a character of the utmost importance in colourless transparent
    stones, which, but for it, would be lacking in interest. Diamond excels
    all colourless stones in this respect, although it is closely followed
    by zircon, the colour of which has been driven off by heating; it is,
    however, surpassed by two coloured species: sphene, which is seldom
    seen in jewellery, and demantoid, the green garnet from the Urals,
    which often passes under the misnomer ‘olivine.’ The dispersion of the
    more prominent species for the <i>B</i> and <i>G</i> lines of the solar spectrum
    is given in <a href="#TABLE_IV">Table IV</a> at the end of the book.</p>

  <p>We will now proceed to discuss methods that may be used for the
    measurement of the refractive indices of cut stones.</p>

    <div class="headingc">MEASUREMENT OF REFRACTIVE INDICES</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE methods available for the measurement of refractive indices are of
    two kinds, and make use of two different principles. The first, which
    is based upon the very simple relation found in the last chapter to
    subsist at total-reflection, can be used with ease and celerity, and is
    best suited for discriminative purposes; but it is restricted in its
    application. The second, which depends on the measurement of the angle
    between two facets and the minimum deviation experienced by a ray of
    light when traversing a prism formed by them, is more involved, entails
    the use of more elaborate apparatus, and takes considerable time, but
    it is less restricted in its application.</p>

  <h3>(1) <span class="smcap">The Method of Total-Reflection</span></h3>

  <p>We see from equation <i>b</i> (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>), connecting the angle of
    total-reflection with the refractive indices of the adjacent media,
    that, if the denser medium be constant, the indices of all less dense
    media may be easily determined from a measurement of the corresponding
    critical angle. In all refractometers the constant medium is a glass
    with a high refractive index. Some instruments have rotatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span> parts, by
    means of which this angle is actually measured. Such instruments give
    very good results, but suffer from the disadvantages of being neither
    portable nor convenient to handle, and of not giving a result without
    some computation.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p022.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="324" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>—Refractometer (actual size).</div>
  </div>

  <p>For use in the identification of cut stones, a refractometer with a
    fixed scale, such as that (Fig. 16) devised by the author, is far
    more convenient. In order to facilitate the observations, a totally
    reflecting prism has been inserted between the two lenses of the
    eyepiece. The eyepiece may be adjusted to suit the individual eyesight;
    but for observers with exceptionally long sight an adapter is provided,
    which permits the eyepiece being drawn out to the requisite extent.
    The refractometer must be held in the manner illustrated in Fig.
    17, so that the light from a window or other source of illumination
    enters the instrument by the lenticular opening underneath. Good,
    even illumination of the field may also very simply be secured by
    reflecting light into the instrument from a sheet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> of white paper laid
    on a table. On looking down the eyepiece we see a scale (Fig. 18), the
    eyepiece being, if necessary, focused until the divisions of the scale
    are clearly and distinctly seen. Suppose, for experiment, we smear a
    little vaseline or similar fatty substance on the plane surface of the
    dense glass, which just projects beyond the level of the brass plate
    embracing it. The field of view is now no longer uniformly illuminated,
    but is divided into two parts (Fig. 19): a dark portion above, which
    terminates in a curved edge, apparently green in colour, and a bright
    portion underneath, which is composed of totally reflected light. If
    we tilt the instrument downwards so that light enters the instrument
    from above through the vaseline we find that the portions of the field
    are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> reversed, the dark portion being underneath and terminated by
    a red edge. It is possible so to arrange the illumination that the
    two portions are evenly lighted, and the common edge becomes almost
    invisible. It is therefore essential for obtaining satisfactory results
    that the plate and the dense glass be shielded from the light by the
    disengaged hand. The shadow-edge is curved, and is, indeed, an arc of a
    circle, because spherical surfaces are used in the optical arrangements
    of the refractometer; by the substitution of cylindrical surfaces it
    becomes straight, but sufficient advantage is not secured thereby to
    compensate for the greatly increased complexity of the construction.
    The shadow-edge is coloured, because the relative dispersion,
    <span class="frac"><sup><i>n<sub>v</sub></i> − <i>n<sub>r</sub></i></sup>
    <span>/</span><sub><i>n</i></sub></span>
    (<i>n<sub>v</sub></i> and <i>n<sub>r</sub></i>
    being the refractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> indices for
    the extreme violet and red rays respectively), of the vaseline differs
    from that of the dense glass. The dispersion of the glass is very
    high, and exceeds that of any stone for which it can be used. Certain
    oils have, however, nearly the same relative dispersion, and the edges
    corresponding to them are consequently almost colourless. A careful eye
    will perceive that the coloured shadow-edge is in reality a spectrum,
    of which the violet end lies in the dark portion of the field and the
    red edge merges into the bright portion. The yellow colour of a sodium
    flame, which, as has already been stated, is selected as the standard
    for the measurement of refractive indices, lies between the green and
    the red, and the part of the spectrum to be noted is at the bottom of
    the green, and practically, therefore, at the bottom of the shadow,
    because the yellow and red are almost lost in the brightness of the
    lower portion of the field. If a sodium flame be used as the source of
    illumination, the shadow-edge becomes a sharply defined line. The scale
    is so graduated and arranged that the reading where this line crosses
    the scale gives the corresponding refractive index, the reading, since
    the line is curved, being taken in the middle of the field on the
    right-hand side of the scale. The refractometer therefore gives at
    once, without any intermediate calculation, a value of the refractive
    index to the second place of decimals, and a skilled observer
    may, by estimating the tenths of the intervals between successive
    divisions, arrive at the third place; to facilitate this estimation
    the semi-divisions beyond 1·650 have been inserted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> The range extends
    nearly to 1·800; for any substance with a higher refractive index the
    field is dark as far as the limit at the bottom.</p>

  <p class="clear">A fat, or a liquid, wets the glass, <i>i.e.</i> comes into intimate contact
    with it, but if a solid substance be tested in the same way, a film of
    air would intervene and entirely prevent an observation. To displace
    it, a drop of some liquid which is more highly refractive than the
    substance under test must first be applied to the plane surface
    of the dense glass. The most convenient liquid for the purpose is
    methylene iodide, CH<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>, which, when pure, has at ordinary room
    temperatures a refractive index of 1·742. It is almost colourless when
    fresh, but turns reddish brown on exposure to light. If desired, it
    may be cleared in the manner described below (p. 66), but the film
    of liquid actually used is so thin that this precaution is scarcely
    necessary. If we test a piece of ordinary glass—one of the slips used
    by microscopists for covering thin sections is very convenient for
    the purpose—first applying a drop of methylene iodide to the plane
    surface of the dense glass of the refractometer (Fig. 20), we notice a
    coloured shadow-edge corresponding to the glass-slip at about 1·530 and
    another, almost colourless, at 1·742, which corresponds to the liquid.
    If the solid substance which is tested is more highly refractive than
    methylene iodide, only the latter of the shadow-edges is visible, and
    we must utilize some more refractive liquid. We can, however, raise
    the refractive index of methylene iodide by dissolving sulphur<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in
    it; the refractive index of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>the saturated liquid lies well beyond
    1·800 and the shadow-edge corresponding to it, therefore, does not
    come within the range of the refractometer. The pure and the saturated
    liquids can be procured with the instrument, the bottles containing
    them being japanned on the outside to exclude light and fitted with
    dipping-stoppers, by means of which a drop of the liquid required is
    easily transferred to the surface of the glass of the instrument.
    So long as the liquid is more highly refractive than the stone, or
    whatever may be the substance under examination, its precise refractive
    index is of no consequence. The facet used in the test must be flat,
    and must be pressed firmly on the instrument, so that it is truly
    parallel to the plane surface of the dense glass; for good results,
    moreover, it must be bright.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span>—Shadow-edges given by a doubly
    refractive substance.</div>
  </div>

  <p>We have so far assumed that the substance which we are testing is
    simple and gives a single shadow-edge; but, as may be seen from Table
    V, many of the gem-stones are doubly refractive, and such will,
    in general, show in the field of the refractometer two distinct
    shadow-edges more or less widely separated. Suppose, for example, we
    study the effect produced by a peridot, which displays the phenomenon
    to a marked degree. If we revolve the stone so that the facet under
    observation remains parallel to the plane surface of the dense glass
    of the refractometer and in contact with it, we notice that both the
    shadow-edges in general move up or down the scale. In particular cases,
    depending upon the relation of the position of the facet selected to
    the crystalline symmetry, one or both of them may remain fixed, or
    one may even move across the other. But whatever facet of the stone
    be used for the test, and however variable be the movements of the
    shadow-edges, the highest and lowest readings obtainable remain the
    same; they are the principal indices of refraction, such as are stated
    in Table III at the end of the book, and their difference measures
    the maximum amount of double refraction possessed by the stone. The
    procedure is therefore simplicity itself; we have merely to revolve
    the stone on the instrument, usually through not more than a right
    angle, and note the greatest and least readings. It will be noticed
    that the shadow-edges cross the scale symmetrically in the critical and
    skewwise in intermediate positions. Fig. 21 represents the effect when
    the facet is such as to give simultaneously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> the two readings required.
    The shadow-edges <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, which are coloured in white light,
    correspond to the least and greatest respectively of the principal
    refractive indices, while the third shadow-edge, which is very faint,
    corresponds to the liquid used—methylene iodide. It is possible, as we
    shall see in a later chapter, to learn from the motion, if any, of the
    shadow-edges something as to the character of the double refraction.
    Since, however, each shadow-edge is spectral in white light, they will
    not be distinctly separate unless the double refraction exceeds the
    relative dispersion. Topaz, for instance, appears in white light to
    yield only a single shadow-edge, and may thus easily be distinguished
    from tourmaline, in which the double refraction is large enough for
    the separation of the two shadow-edges to be clearly discerned. In
    sodium light, however, no difficulty is experienced in distinguishing
    both the shadow-edges given by substances with small amount of double
    refraction, such as chrysoberyl, quartz, and topaz, and a skilled
    observer may detect the separation in the extreme instances of apatite,
    idocrase, and beryl. The shadow-edge corresponding to the greater
    refractive index is always less distinct, because it lies in the bright
    portion of the field. If the stone or its facet be small, it must
    be moved on the plane surface of the dense glass until the greatest
    possible distinctness is imparted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> edge or edges. If it be moved
    towards the observer from the further end, a misty shadow appears to
    move down the scale until the correct position is reached, when the
    edges spring into view.</p>

  <p>Any facet of a stone may be utilized so long as it is flat, but the
    table-facet is the most convenient, because it is usually the largest,
    and it is available even when the stone is mounted. That the stone need
    not be removed from its setting is one of the great advantages of this
    method. The smaller the stone the more difficult it is to manipulate;
    caution especially must be exercised that it be not tilted, not only
    because the shadow-edge would be shifted from its true position and an
    erroneous value of the refractive index obtained, but also because a
    corner or edge of the stone would inevitably scratch the glass of the
    instrument, which is far softer than the hard gem-stones. Methylene
    iodide will in time attack and stain the glass, and must therefore be
    wiped off the instrument immediately after use.</p>

  <h3>(2) <span class="smcap">The Method of Minimum Deviation</span></h3>

  <p>If the stone be too highly refractive for a measurement of its
    refractive index to be possible with the refractometer just described,
    and it is desired to determine this constant, recourse must be had
    to the prismatic method, for which purpose an instrument known as
    a goniometer<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is required.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>Two angles must be measured; one the
    interior angle included between a suitable pair of facets, and the
    other the minimum amount of the deviation produced by the pair upon a
    beam of light traversing them.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <div class="center"><img src="images/i_p031.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="300" /></div>
    <div class="caption w275"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>—Path at Minimum Deviation
    of a Ray<br />traversing a Prism formed of two Facets of a<br />Cut Stone.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 22 represents a section of a step-cut stone perpendicular to a
    series of facets with parallel edges; <i>t</i> is the table, and <i>a, b, c</i>,
    are facets on the culet side. The path of light traversing the prism
    formed by the pair of facets, <i>t</i> and <i>b</i>, is indicated. Suppose that
    <i>A</i> is the interior angle of the prism, <i>i</i> the angle of incidence of
    light at the first facet and <i>i´</i> the angle of emergence at the second
    facet, and <i>r</i> and <i>r´</i> the angles inside the stone at the two facets
    respectively. Then at the first facet light has been bent through an
    angle <i>i - r</i>, and again at the second facet through an angle <i>i´ -
      r´</i>; the angle of deviation, <i>D</i>, is therefore given by</p>

  <p class="center"><i>D = i + i´ - (r + r´)</i>.</p>

  <p class="noindent">We have further that</p>

  <p class="center"><i>r + r´ = A</i>,</p>

  <p class="noindent">whence it follows that</p>

  <p class="center"><i>A + D = i + i´.</i></p>

  <p>If the stone be mounted on the goniometer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> and adjusted so that the
    edge of the prism is parallel to the axis of rotation of the instrument
    and if light from the collimator fall upon the table-facet and the
    telescope be turned to the proper position to receive the emergent
    beam, a spectral image of the object-slit, or in the case of a doubly
    refractive stone in general, two spectral images, will be seen in
    white light; in the light of a sodium flame the images will be sharp
    and distinct. Suppose that we rotate the stone in the direction of
    diminishing deviation and simultaneously the telescope so as to retain
    an image in the field of view, we find that the image moves up to and
    then away from a certain position, at which, therefore, the deviation
    is a minimum. The image moves in the same direction from this position
    whichever way the stone be rotated. The question then arises what are
    the angles of incidence and refraction under these special conditions.
    It is clear that a path of light is reversible; that is to say, if a
    beam of light traverses the prism from the facet <i>t</i> to the facet <i>b</i>
    it can take precisely the same path from the facet <i>b</i> to the facet
    <i>t</i>. Hence we should be led to expect that, since experiment teaches us
    that there is only one position of minimum deviation corresponding to
    the same pair of facets, the angles at the two facets must be equal,
    <i>i.e.</i> <i>i = i´</i>, and <i>r = r´</i>. It is, indeed, not difficult to prove by
    either geometrical or analytical methods that such is the case.</p>

  <p>Therefore at minimum deviation
    <i>r</i> = <span class="frac"><sup><i>A</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span>
    and <i>i</i> = <span class="frac"><sup><i>A</i> + <i>D</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span>
    and, since sin <i>i</i> = <i>n</i> sin <i>r</i>, where <i>n</i> is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> the refractive index of
    the stone, we have the simple relation—</p>

  <div class="center">
    <i>n</i> =  <span class="frac">
    <sup>sin <span class="frac"><sup><i>A</i> + <i>D</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span></sup>
    <span>/</span>
    <sub>sin <span class="frac"><sup><i>A</i></sup><span>/</span><sub>2</sub></span></sub></span>
  </div>

  <p>This relation is strictly true only when the direction of minimum
    deviation is one of crystalline symmetry in the stone, and holds
    therefore in general for all singly refractive stones, and for the
    ordinary ray of a uniaxial stone; but the values thus obtained even in
    the case of biaxial stones are approximate enough for discriminative
    purposes. If then the stone be singly refractive, the result is the
    index required; if it be uniaxial, one value is the ordinary index
    and the other image gives a value lying between the ordinary and the
    extraordinary indices; if it be biaxial, the values given by the two
    images may lie anywhere between the greatest and the least refractive
    indices. The angle <i>A</i> must not be too large; otherwise the light will
    not emerge at the second facet, but will be totally reflected inside
    the stone: on the other hand, it must not be too small, because any
    error in its determination would then seriously affect the accuracy of
    the value derived for the refractive index. Although the monochromatic
    light of a sodium flame is essential for precise work, a sufficiently
    approximate value for discriminative purposes is obtained by noting the
    position of the yellow portion of the spectral image given in white
    light.</p>

  <p>In the case of a stone such as that depicted in Fig. 22 images are
    given by other pairs of facets, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> instance <i>ta</i> and <i>tc</i>, unless the
    angle included by the former is too large. There might therefore be
    some doubt, to which pair some particular image corresponded; but no
    confusion can arise if the following procedure be adopted.</p>

  <div class="figleft w325">
    <div class="center"><img src="images/i_p034.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="268" /></div>
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>—Course of Observations in
    the Method of Minimum Deviation.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The table, or some easily recognizable facet, is selected as the facet
    at which light enters the stone. The telescope is first placed in the
    position in which it is directly opposite the collimator (<i>T<sub>0</sub></i> in
    Fig. 23), and clamped. The scale is turned until it reads exactly
    zero, 0° or 360°, and clamped. The telescope is released and revolved
    in the direction of increasing readings of the scale to the position
    of minimum deviation, <i>T</i>. The reading of the scale gives at once the
    angle of minimum deviation, <i>D</i>. The holder carrying the stone is now
    clamped to the scale, and the telescope is turned to the position,
    <i>T<sub>1</sub></i>,in which the image given by reflection from the table facet is
    in the centre of the field of view; the reading of the scale is taken.
    The telescope is clamped, and the scale is released and rotated until
    it reads the angle already found for <i>D</i>. If no mistake has been made,
    the reflected image from the second facet is now in the field of view.
    It will probably not be quite central, as theoretically it should be,
    because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> stone may not have been originally quite in the position
    of minimum deviation, a comparatively large rotation of the stone
    producing no apparent change in the position of the refracted image at
    minimum deviation, and further, because, as has already been stated,
    the method is not strictly true for biaxial stones. The difference in
    readings, however, should not exceed 2°. The reading, <i>S</i>, of the scale
    is now taken, and it together with 180° subtracted from the reading for
    the first facet, and the value of <i>A</i>, the interior angle between the
    two facets, obtained.</p>

  <p>The readings <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> are very nearly the same, and therefore we may
    be sure that no mistake has been made in the selection of the facets.</p>

  <p>In place of logarithm-tables we may make use of the diagram on <a href="#Plate_II">Plate
    II</a>. The radial lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> correspond to the angles of minimum deviation and
    the skew lines to the prism angles, and the distance along the radial
    lines gives the refractive index. We run our eye along the line for the
    observed angle of minimum deviation and note where it meets the curve
    for the observed prism angle; the refractive index corresponding to the
    point of intersection is at once read off.</p>

  <p>This method has several obvious disadvantages: it requires the use
    of an expensive and elaborate instrument, an observation takes

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT has been already stated that whenever light in one medium falls
    upon the surface separating it from another medium some of the light
    is reflected within the first, while the remainder passes out into
    the second medium, except when the first is of lower refractivity
    than the second and light falls at an angle greater than that of
    total-reflection. Similarly, when light impinges upon a cut stone
    some of it is reflected and the remainder passes into the stone. What
    is the relative amount of reflected light depends upon the nature of
    the stone—its refractivity and hardness—and determines its lustre;
    the greater the amount the more lustrous will the stone appear. There
    are different kinds of lustre, and the intensity of each depends on
    the polish of the surface. From a dull, <i>i.e.</i> an uneven, surface the
    reflected light is scattered, and there are no brilliant reflections.
    All gem-stones take a good polish, and have therefore, so long as the
    surface retains its polish, considerable brilliancy; turquoise, on
    account of its softness, is always comparatively dull.</p>

  <p>The different kinds of lustre are—</p>

  <ol class="paren">
    <li>Adamantine, characteristic of diamond.</li>
    <li>Vitreous, as seen on the surface of fractured glass.</li>
    <li>Resinous, as shown by resins.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

  <p class="noindent">Zircon and demantoid, the green garnet called by jewellers “olivine,”
    alone among gem-stones have a lustre approaching that of diamond. The
    remainder all have a vitreous lustre, though varying in degree, the
    harder and the more refractive species being on the whole the more
    lustrous.</p>

  <p>Some stones—for instance, a cinnamon garnet—appear to have a certain
    greasiness in the lustre, which is caused by stray reflections from
    inclusions or other breaks in the homogeneity of the interior. A pearly
    lustre, which arises from cleavage cracks and is typically displayed
    by the cleavage face of topaz, would be seen in a cut stone only when
    flawed.</p>

  <p>Certain corundums when viewed in the direction of the
    crystallographical axis display six narrow lines of light radiating at
    angles of 60° from a centre in a manner suggestive of the conventional
    representations of stars. Such stones are consequently known as
    asterias, or more usually star-stones—star-rubies or star-sapphires, as
    the case may be, and the phenomenon is called asterism. These stones
    have not a homogeneous structure, but contain tube-like cavities
    regularly arranged at angles of 60° in planes at right angles to the
    crystallographical axis. The effect is best produced when the stones
    are cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i> perpendicular to that axis.</p>

  <p>Chatoyancy is a somewhat similar phenomenon, but in this case the
    fibres or cavities are parallel to a single direction, and a single
    broadish band is displayed at right angles to it. Cat’s-eyes, as these
    stones are termed, are cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i> parallel to the fibres. The
    true cat’s-eye (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 1)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> is a variety of chrysoberyl, but
    the term is also often applied to quartz showing a similar appearance.
    The latter is really a fibrous mineral, such as asbestos, which has
    become converted into silica. The beautiful tiger’s-eye from South
    Africa is a silicified crocidolite, the original blue colour of which
    has been altered by oxidation to golden brown. Recently tourmalines
    have been discovered which are sufficiently fibrous in structure to
    display an effective chatoyancy.</p>

  <p>The milky sheen of moonstone (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 4) owes its effect to
    reflections from twin lamellæ. The wonderful iridescence which is
    the glory of opal, and is therefore termed opalescence, arises from
    a structure which is peculiar to that species. Opal is a solidified
    jelly; on cooling it has become riddled with extremely thin cracks,
    which were subsequently filled with similar material of slightly
    different refractivity, and thus it consists of a series of films. At
    the surface of each film interference of light takes place just as
    at the surface of a soap-bubble, and the more evenly the films are
    spaced apart the more uniform is the colour displayed, the actual tint
    depending upon the thickness of the films traversed by the light giving
    rise to the phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="headingc">DOUBLE REFRACTION</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE optical phenomenon presented by many gem-stones is complicated
    by their property of splitting up a beam of light into two with, in
    general, differing characters. In this chapter we shall discuss the
    nature of double refraction, as it is termed, and methods for its
    detection. The phenomenon is not one that comes within the purview of
    everyday experience.</p>

  <p>So long ago as 1669 a Danish physician, by name Bartholinus, noticed
    that a plate of the transparent mineral which at that time had
    recently been brought over from Iceland, and was therefore called
    “Iceland-spar,” possessed the remarkable property of giving a double
    image of objects close to it when viewed through it. Subsequent
    investigation has shown that much crystallized matter is doubly
    refractive, but in calcite—to use the scientific name for the species
    which includes Iceland-spar—alone among common minerals is the
    phenomenon so conspicuous as to be obvious to the unaided eye. The
    apparent separation of the pair of images given by a plate cut or
    cleaved in any direction depends upon its thickness. The large mass,
    upwards of two feet (60 cm.) in thickness, which is exhibited at
    the far end of the Mineral Gallery of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> Museum (Natural
    History), displays the separation to a degree that is probably unique.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>—Apparent doubling of the Edges of a
    Peridot when viewed through the Table-Facet.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Although none of the gem-stones can emulate calcite in this character,
    yet the double refraction of certain of them is large enough to be
    detected without much difficulty. In the case of faceted stones the
    opposite edges should be viewed through the table-facet, and any signs
    of doubling noted. The double refraction of sphene is so large, viz.
    0·08, that the doubling of the edges is evident to the unaided eye.
    In peridot (Fig. 24), zircon (b), and epidote the apparent separation
    of the edges is easily discerned with the assistance of an ordinary
    lens. A keen eye can detect the phenomenon even in the case of such
    substances as quartz with small double refraction. It must, however, be
    remembered that in all such stones the refraction is single in certain
    directions, and the amount of double refraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> varies therefore
    with the direction from nil to the maximum possessed by the stone.
    Experiment with a plate of Iceland-spar shows that the rays transmitted
    by it have properties differing from those of ordinary light. On
    superposing a second plate we notice that there are now two pairs of
    images, which are in general no longer of equal brightness, as was the
    case before. If the second plate be rotated with respect to the first,
    two images, one of each pair, disappear, and then the other two, the
    plate having turned through a right angle between the two positions of
    extinction; midway between these positions the images are all equally
    bright. This variation of intensity implies that each of the rays
    emerging from the first plate has acquired a one-sided character, or,
    as it is usually expressed, has become plane-polarized, or, shortly,
    polarized.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p042.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="124" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>—Wave-Motion.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Before the discovery of the phenomenon of double refraction the
    foundation of the modern theory of light had been laid by the genius of
    Huygens. According to this theory light is the result of a wave-motion
    (Fig. 25) in the ether, a medium that pervades the whole of space
    whether occupied by matter or not, and transmits the wave-motion at a
    rate varying with the matter with which it happens to coincide. Such
    a medium has been assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> because it explains satisfactorily all the
    phenomena of light, but it by no means follows that it has a concrete
    existence. Indeed, if it has, it is so tenuous as to be imperceptible
    to the most delicate experiments. The wave-motion is similar to that
    observed on the surface of still water when disturbed by a stone flung
    into it. The waves spread out from the source of disturbance; but,
    although the waves seem to advance, the actual particles of water
    merely move up and down, and have no motion at all in the direction
    in which the waves are moving. If we imagine similar motion to take
    place in any plane and not only the horizontal, we form some idea
    of the nature of ordinary light. But after passing through a plate
    of Iceland-spar, light no longer vibrates in all directions, but in
    each beam the vibrations are parallel to a particular plane, the two
    planes being at right angles. The exact relation of the direction of
    the vibrations to the plane of polarization is uncertain, although it
    undoubtedly lies in the plane containing the direction of the ray of
    light and the perpendicular to the plane of polarization. The waves for
    different colours differ in their length, <i>i.e.</i> in the distance, 2
    <i>bb</i> (Fig. 25), from crest to crest, while the velocity, which remains
    the same for the same medium, is proportional to the wave-length. The
    intensity of the light varies as the square of the amplitude of the
    wave, <i>i.e.</i> the height, <i>ab</i>, of the crest from the mean level.</p>

  <p>Various methods have been proposed for obtaining polarized light. Thus
    Seebeck found in 1813 that a plate of brown tourmaline cut parallel
    to the crystallographic axis and of sufficient thickness (cf. <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>)
    transmits only one ray, the other being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> entirely absorbed within the
    plate. Another method was to employ a glass plate to reflect light at a
    certain critical angle. The most efficient method, and that in general
    use at the present day, is due to the invention of Nicol. A rhomb of
    Iceland-spar (Fig. 26), of suitable length, is sliced along the longer
    diagonal, <i>dd</i>, and the halves are cemented together by means of canada
    balsam. One ray, <i>ioo</i>, is totally reflected at the surface separating
    the mineral and the cement, and does not penetrate into the other half;
    while the other ray, <i>iee</i>, is transmitted with almost undiminished
    intensity. Such a rhomb is called a Nicol’s prism after its inventor,
    or briefly, a nicol.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_p044.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="170" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—Nicol’s Prism.</div>
  </div>

  <p>If one nicol be placed above another and their corresponding principal
    planes be at right angles no light is transmitted through the pair.
    In the polarizing microscope one such nicol, called the polarizer, is
    placed below the stage, and the other, called the analyser, is either
    inserted in the body of the microscope or placed above the eyepiece,
    and the pair are usually set in the crossed position so that the field
    of the microscope is dark. If a piece of glass or a fragment of some
    singly refractive substance be placed on the stage the field still
    remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> dark; but in case of a doubly refractive stone the field is
    no longer dark except in certain positions of the stone. On rotation
    of the plate, or, if possible, of the nicols together, the field
    passes from darkness to maximum brightness four times in a complete
    revolution, the relative angular intervals between these positions
    being right angles. These positions of darkness are known as the
    positions of extinction, and the plate is said to extinguish in them.
    This test is exceedingly delicate and reveals the double refraction
    even when the greatest difference in the refractive indices is too
    small to be measured directly.</p>

  <p>Doubly refractive substances are of two kinds: uniaxial, in which
    there is one direction of single refraction, and biaxial, in which
    there are two such directions. In the case of the former the direction
    of one, the ordinary ray, is precisely the same as if the refraction
    were single, but the refractive index of the other ray varies from
    that of the ordinary ray to a second limiting value, the extraordinary
    refractive index, which may be either greater or less. If the
    extraordinary is greater than the ordinary refractive index the double
    refraction is said to be positive; if less, to be negative. A biaxial
    substance is more complex. It possesses three principal directions,
    viz., the bisectrices of the directions of single refraction and the
    perpendicular to the plane containing them. The first two correspond
    to the greatest and least, and the last to the mean of the principal
    indices of refraction. If the acute bisectrix corresponds to the
    least refractive index, the double refraction is said to be positive,
    and if to the greatest, negative. The relation of the directions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>of
    single refraction, <i>s</i>, to the three principal directions, <i>a, b, c</i>,
    is illustrated in Fig. 27 for the case of topaz, a positive mineral.
    The refractive indices of the rays traversing one of the principal
    directions have the values corresponding to the other two. In the
    direction <i>a</i> we should measure the greatest and the mean of the
    principal refractive indices, in the direction <i>b</i> the greatest and the
    least, and in the direction <i>c</i> the mean and the least. The maximum
    amount of double refraction is therefore in the direction <i>b</i>.</p>

    Directions of single Refraction to<br />the principal Optical Directions<br />in a Biaxial
    Crystal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In the examination of a faceted stone, of the most usual shape, the
    simplest method is to lay the large facet, called the table, on a glass
    slip and view the stone through the small parallel facet, the culet.
    Should the latter not exist, it may frequently happen that owing to
    internal reflection no light emerges through the steeply inclined
    facets. This difficulty is easily overcome by immersing the stone in
    some highly refracting oil. A glass plate held by hand over the stone
    with a drop of the oil between it and the plate serves the purpose, and
    is perhaps a more convenient method. A stone which does not possess a
    pair of parallel facets should be viewed through any pair which are
    nearly parallel.</p>

  <p>We have stated that a plate of glass has no effect on the field.
    Suppose, however, it were viewed when placed between the jaws of a
    tightened vice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> and thus thrown into a state of strain, it would then
    show double refraction, the amount of which would depend on the strain.
    Natural singly refractive substances frequently show phenomena of a
    similar kind. Thus diamond sometimes contains a drop of liquid carbonic
    acid, and the strain is revealed by the coloured rings surrounding
    the cavity which are seen when the stone is viewed between crossed
    nicols. Double refraction is also common in diamond even when there is
    no included matter to explain it, and is caused by the state of strain
    into which the mineral is thrown on release from the enormous pressure
    under which it was formed. Other minerals which display these so-called
    optical anomalies, such as fluor and garnet, are not really quite
    singly refractive at ordinary temperatures; each crystal is composed
    of several double refractive individuals. But all such phenomena
    cannot be confused with the characters of minerals which extinguish
    in the ordinary way, since the stone will extinguish in small patches
    and these will not be dark all at the same time; further, the double
    refraction is small, and on revolving the stone between crossed nicols
    the extinction is not sharp. Paste stones are sometimes in a state of
    strain, and display slight, but general, double refraction. Hence the
    existence of double refraction does not necessarily prove that the
    stone is real and not an imitation. Stones may be composed of two or
    more individuals which are related to each other by twinning, in which
    case each individual would in general extinguish separately. Such
    individuals would be larger and would extinguish more sharply than the
    patches of an anomalous stone.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>—Interference of Light.</div>
  </div>

  <p>An examination in convergent light is sometimes of service. An
    auxiliary lens is placed over the condenser so as to converge the light
    on to the stone. Light now traverses the stone in different directions;
    the more oblique the direction the greater the distance traversed in
    the stone. If it be doubly refractive, in any given direction there
    will be in general two rays with differing refractive indices and the
    resulting effect is akin to the well-known phenomenon of Newton’s
    rings, and is an instance of what is termed interference. It may be
    mentioned that the interference of light (Fig. 28) explains such common
    phenomena as the colours of a soap-bubble, the hues of tarnished steel,
    the tints of a layer of oil floating on water, and so on. Light, after
    diverging from the stone, comes to focus a little beneath the plane
    in which the image of the stone is formed. An auxiliary lens must,
    therefore, be inserted to bring the focal planes together, so that the
    interference picture may be viewed by means of the same eyepiece.</p>

  <p>If a uniaxial crystal be examined along the crystallographic axis in
    convergent light an interference picture will be seen of the kind
    illustrated on <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>. The arms of a black cross meet in the centre
    of the field, which is surrounded by a series of circular rings,
    coloured in white light. Rotation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> of the stone about the axis
    produces no change in the picture.</p>

  <div class="caption">INTERFERENCE FIGURES</div>

  <p>A biaxial substance possesses two directions (<em>the optic axes</em>) along
    which a single beam is transmitted. If such a stone be examined along
    the line bisecting the acute angle between the optic axes (<em>the acute
    bisectrix</em>) an interference picture<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> will be seen which in particular
    positions of the stone with respect to the crossed nicols takes the
    forms illustrated on <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>. As before, there is a series of rings
    which are coloured in white light; they, however, are no longer circles
    but consist of curves known as lemniscates, of which the figure of 8
    is a special form. Instead of an unchangeable cross there are a pair
    of black “brushes” which in one position of the stone are hyperbolæ,
    and in that at right angles become a cross. On rotating the stone we
    find that the rings move with it and are unaltered in form, whereas the
    brushes revolve about two points, called the “eyes,” where the optic
    axes emerge. If the observation were made along the obtuse bisectrix
    the angle between the optic axes would probably be too large for the
    brushes to come into the field, and the rings might not be visible in
    white light, though they would appear in monochromatic light. In the
    case of a substance like sphene the figure is not so simple, because
    the positions of the optic axes vary greatly for the different colours
    and the result is exceedingly complex; in monochromatic light, however,
    the usual figure is visible.</p>

  <p>It would probably not be possible in the case of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>a faceted stone
    to find a pair of faces perpendicular to the required direction.
    Nevertheless, so long as a portion of the figures described is in the
    field of view, the character of the double refraction, whether uniaxial
    or biaxial, may readily be determined.</p>

  <p>There is yet another remarkable phenomenon which must not be passed
    over. Certain substances, of which quartz is a conspicuous example and
    in this respect unique among the gem-stones, possess the remarkable
    property of rotating the plane of polarization of a ray of light which
    is transmitted parallel to the optic axis. If a plate of quartz be
    cut at right angles to the axis and placed between crossed nicols in
    white light, the field will be coloured, the hue changing on rotation
    of one nicol with respect to the other. Examination in monochromatic
    light shows that the field will become dark after a certain rotation of
    the one nicol with respect to the other, the amount of which depends
    on the thickness of the plate. If the plate be viewed in convergent
    light, an interference picture is seen as illustrated on <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>,
    which is similar to, and yet differs in some important particulars
    from the ordinary interference picture of a uniaxial stone. The cross
    does not penetrate beyond the innermost ring and the centre of the
    field is coloured in white light. If a stone shows such a picture, it
    may be safely assumed to be quartz. It is interesting to note that
    minerals which possess this property have a spiral arrangement of the
    constituent atoms.</p>

  <p>It has already been remarked (<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>) that if a faceted doubly
    refractive stone be rotated with one facet always in contact with the
    dense glass of the refractometer the pair of shadow-edges that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    visible in the field move up or down the scale in general from or
    to maximum and minimum positions. The manner in which this movement
    takes place depends upon the character of the double refraction and
    the position of the facet under observation with regard to the optical
    symmetry of the stone. In the case of a uniaxial stone, if the facet
    be perpendicular to the crystallographic axis, i.e. the direction
    of single refraction, neither of the shadow-edges will move. If the
    facet be parallel to that direction, one shadow-edge will move up and
    coincide with the other, which remains invariable in position, and
    away from it to a second critical position; the latter gives the value
    of the extraordinary refractive index, and the invariable shadow-edge
    corresponds to the ordinary refractive index. This phenomenon is
    displayed by the table-facet of most tourmalines, because for
    reasons given above (<a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>) they are as a rule cut parallel to the
    crystallographic axis. In the case of facets in intermediate positions,
    the shadow-edge corresponding to the extraordinary refractive index
    moves, but not to coincidence with the invariable shadow-edge. The case
    of a biaxial stone is more complex. If the facet be perpendicular to
    one of the principal directions one shadow-edge remains invariable in
    position, corresponding to one of the principal refractive indices,
    whilst the other moves between the critical values corresponding
    to the remaining two of the principal refractive indices. In the
    interesting case in which the facet is parallel to the two directions
    of single refraction, the second shadow-edge moves across the one which
    is invariable in position. In intermediate positions of the facet
    both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> shadow-edges move, and give therefore critical values. Of the
    intermediate pair, <i>i.e.</i> the lower maximum and the higher minimum,
    one corresponds to the mean principal refractive index, and the other
    depends upon the relation of the facet to the optical symmetry. If it
    is desired to distinguish between them, observations must be made on
    a second facet; but for discriminative purposes such exactitude is
    unnecessary, since the least and the greatest refractive indices are
    all that are required.</p>

    <div class="headingc">ABSORPTION EFFECTS: COLOUR, DICHROISM, ETC.</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHEN white light passes through a cut stone, colour effects result
    which arise from a variety of causes. The most obvious is the
    fundamental colour of the stone, which is due to its selective
    absorption of the light passing through it, and would characterize
    it before it was cut. Intermingled with the colour in a transparent
    stone is the dispersive effect known as ‘fire,’ which has already
    been discussed (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>). In many instances the want of homogeneity is
    responsible for some peculiar effects such as opalescence, chatoyancy,
    and asterism. These phenomena will now be considered in fuller detail.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Colour</span></h3>

  <p>All substances absorb light to some extent. If the action is slight and
    affects equally the whole of the visible spectrum, the stone appears
    white or colourless. Usually some portion is more strongly absorbed
    than the rest, and the stone seems to be coloured. What is the precise
    tint depends not only upon the portions transmitted through the stone,
    but also upon their relative intensities. The eye, unlike the ear, has
    not the power of analysis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span> and it cannot of itself determine how a
    composite colour has been made up. Indeed, so far as it is concerned,
    any colour may be exactly matched by compounding in certain proportions
    three simple primary colours—red, yellow, and violet. Alexandrite, a
    variety of chrysoberyl, is a curious and instructive case. The balance
    in the spectrum of light transmitted through it is such that, whereas
    in daylight such stones appear green, in artificial light, especially
    in gas-light, they are a pronounced raspberry-red (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>,
    Figs. 11, 13). The phenomenon is intensified by the strong dichroism
    characteristic of this species.</p>

  <p>The colour is the least reliable character that may be employed for the
    identification of a stone, since it varies considerably in the same
    species, and often results from the admixture of some metallic oxide,
    which has no essential part in the chemical composition and is present
    in such minute quantities as to be almost imperceptible by analysis.
    Who would, for instance, imagine from their appearance that stones so
    markedly diverse in hue as ruby and sapphire were really varieties of
    the same species, corundum? Again, quartz, in spite of the simplicity
    of its composition, displays extreme differences of tint. Nevertheless,
    certain varieties do possess a distinctive colour, emerald being
    the most striking example, and in other cases the trained eye can
    appreciate certain characteristic subtleties of shade. At any rate, the
    colour is the most obvious of the physical characters, and serves to
    provide a rough division of the species, and accordingly in Table II at
    the end of the book the gem-stones are arranged by their usual tints.</p>

  <h3>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
    <span class="smcap">Dichroism</span>
    </h3>

  <p>The two rays into which a doubly refractive stone splits up a ray of
    light are often differently absorbed by it, and in consequence appear
    on emergence differently coloured; such stones are said to be dichroic.
    The most striking instance is a deep-brown tourmaline, which, except
    in very thin sections, is quite opaque to the ordinary ray. The light
    transmitted by a plate cut parallel to the crystallographic axis is
    therefore plane-polarized; before the invention by Nicol of the prism
    of Iceland-spar known by his name this was the ordinary method of
    obtaining light of this character (cf. p. 43). Again, in the case of
    kunzite and cordierite the difference in colour is so marked as to be
    obvious to the unaided eye; but where the contrast is less pronounced
    we require the use of an instrument called a dichroscope, which enables
    the twin colours to be seen side by side.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>—Field of the Dichroscope.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 29 illustrates in section the construction of a dichroscope. The
    instrument consists essentially of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> a rhomb of Iceland-spar, <i>S</i>, of
    such a length as to give two contiguous images (Fig. 30) of a square
    hole, <i>H</i>, in one end of the tube containing it. In some instruments
    the terminal faces of the rhomb are ground at right angles to its
    length, but usually, as in that depicted, prisms of glass, <i>G</i>, are
    cemented on to the two ends. A cap <i>C</i>, with a slightly larger hole,
    which is circular in shape, fits on the end of the tube, and can be
    moved up and down it and revolved round it, as desired. The stone, <i>R</i>,
    to be tested may be directly attached to it by means of some kind of
    wax or cement in such a way that light which has traversed it passes
    into the window, <i>H</i>, of the instrument; the cap at the same time
    permits of the rotation of the stone about the axis of the main tube of
    the instrument. The dichroscope shown in the figure has a still more
    convenient arrangement: it is provided with an additional attachment,
    <i>A</i>, by means of which the stone can be turned about an axis at right
    angles to the length of the tube, and thus examined in different
    directions. At the other end of the main tube is placed a lens, <i>L</i>, of
    low power for viewing the twin images: the short tube containing it can
    be pushed in and out for focusing purposes. Many makers now place the
    rhomb close to the lens, <i>L</i>, and thereby require a much smaller piece
    of spar; material suitable for optical purposes is fast growing scarce.</p>

  <p>Suppose that a plate of tourmaline cut parallel to its crystallographic
    axis is fastened to the cap and the latter rotated. We should notice,
    on looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> through the instrument, that in the course of a complete
    revolution there are two positions, orientated at right angles to
    one another, in which the tints of the two images are identical, the
    positions of greatest contrast of tint being midway between. If we
    examine a uniaxial stone in a direction at right angles to its optic
    axis we obtain the colours corresponding to the ordinary and the
    extraordinary rays. In any direction less inclined to the axis we
    still have the colour for the ordinary ray, but the other colour is
    intermediate in tint between it and that for the extraordinary ray.
    The phenomenon presented by a biaxial stone is more complex. There
    are three principal colours which are visible in differing pairs in
    the three principal optical directions; in other directions the tints
    seen are intermediate between the principal colours. Since biaxial
    stones have three principal colours, they are sometimes said to be
    trichroic or pleochroic, but in any single direction they have two
    twin colours and show dichroism. No difference at all will be shown in
    directions in which a stone is singly refractive, and it is therefore
    always advisable to examine a stone in more than one direction lest
    the first happens to be one of single refraction. For determinative
    purposes it is not necessary to note the exact shades of tint of the
    twin colours, because they vary with the inherent colour of the stone,
    and are therefore not constant for the same species; we need only
    observe, when the stone is tested with the dichroscope, whether there
    is any variation of colour, and, if so, its strength. Dichroism is a
    result of double refraction, and cannot exist in a singly refractive
    stone. The converse, however, is not true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> and it by no means follows
    that, because no dichroism can be detected in a stone, it is singly
    refractive. A colourless stone, for instance, cannot possibly be
    dichroic, and many coloured, doubly refractive stones—for example,
    zircon—exhibit no dichroism, or so little that it is imperceptible.
    The character is always the better displayed, the deeper the inherent
    colour of the stone. The deep-green alexandrite, for instance, is far
    more dichroic than the lighter coloured varieties of chrysoberyl.</p>

  <p>If the stone is attached to the cap of the instrument, the table should
    be turned towards it so as to assure that the light passing into the
    instrument has actually traversed the stone. If little light enters
    through the opposite coign, a drop of oil placed thereon will overcome
    the difficulty (cf. <a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>). It is also necessary, for reasons mentioned
    above, to examine the stone in directions as far as possible across
    the girdle also. A convenient, though not strictly accurate, method
    is to lay the stone with the table facet on a table and examine the
    light which has entered the stone and been reflected at that facet. The
    stone may easily be rotated on the table, and observations thus made
    in different directions in the stone. Care must be exercised in the
    case of a faceted stone not to mistake the alteration in colour due to
    dispersion for a dichroic effect, and the stone must be placed close to
    the instrument during an observation, because otherwise the twin rays
    traversing the instrument may have taken sensibly different directions
    in the stone.</p>

  <p>Dichroism is an effective test in the case of ruby; its twin
    colours—purplish and yellowish red—are in marked contrast, and readily
    distinguish it from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> other red stones. Again, one of the twin colours
    of sapphire is distinctly more yellowish than the other; the blue
    spinel, of which a good many have been manufactured during recent
    years, is singly refractive, and, of course, shows no difference of
    tint in the dichroscope.</p>

  <p><a href="#TABLE_VI">Table VI</a> at the end of the book gives the strength of the dichroism of
    the gem-stones.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Absorption Spectra</span></h3>

  <p>A study of the chromatic character of the light transmitted by a
    coloured stone is of no little interest. As was stated above, the eye
    has not the power of analysing light, and to resolve the transmitted
    rays into their component parts an instrument known as a spectroscope
    is needed. The small ‘direct-vision’ type has ample dispersion for this
    purpose. It is advantageous to employ by preference the diffraction
    rather than the prism form, because in the former the intervals in the
    resulting spectrum corresponding to equal differences of wave-length
    are the same, whereas in the latter they diminish as the wave-length
    increases and accordingly the red end of the spectrum is relatively
    cramped.</p>

  <p>The absorptive properties of all doubly refractive coloured substances
    vary more or less with the direction in which light traverses them
    according to the amount of dichroism that they possess, but the
    variation is not very noticeable unless the stone is highly dichroic.
    If the light transmitted by a deep-coloured ruby be examined with a
    spectroscope it will be found that the whole of the green portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> of
    the spectrum is obliterated (Fig. 31), while in the case of a sapphire
    only a small portion of the red end of the spectrum is absorbed.
    Alexandrite affords especial interest. In the spectrum of the light
    transmitted by it, the violet and the yellow are more or less strongly
    absorbed, depending upon the direction in which the rays have passed
    through the stone (Fig. 31), and the transmitted light is mainly
    composed of two portions—red and green. The apparent colour of the
    stone depends, therefore, upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> which of the two predominates. In
    daylight the resultant colour is green flecked with red and orange,
    the three principal absorptive tints (cf. <a href="#Page_235">p. 235</a>), but in artificial
    light, which is relatively stronger in the red portion of the spectrum,
    the resultant colour is a raspberry-red, and there is less apparent
    difference in the absorptive tints (cf. <a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Figs. 11, 13).</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img id="i_p060" src="images/i_p060.jpg" width="430" height="598" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>—Absorption Spectra.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In all the spectra just considered, and in all like them, the portions
    that are absorbed are wide, the passage from blackness to colour is
    gradual, and the edges deliminating them are blurred. In the spectra of
    certain zircons and in almandine garnet the absorbed portions, or bands
    as they are called, are narrow, and, moreover, the transition from
    blackness to colour is sharp and abrupt; such stones are therefore said
    to display absorption-bands. Church in 1866 was the first to notice
    the bands shown by zircon (Fig. 31). Sorby thought they portended the
    existence of a new element, to which he gave the name jargonium, but
    subsequently discovered that they were caused by the presence of a
    minute trace of uranium. A yellowish-green zircon shows the phenomenon
    best, and it has all the bands shown in the figure. The spectrum varies
    slightly but almost imperceptibly with the direction in the stone.
    Others show the bands in the yellow and green, while others show only
    those in the red, and some only one of them. The bands are not confined
    to stones of any particular colour, or amount of double refraction.
    Again, many zircons show no bands at all, so that their absence by no
    means precludes the stone from being a zircon.</p>

  <p>Almandine is characterized by a different spectrum (Fig. 31). The band
    in the yellow is the most conspicuous, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>and is no doubt responsible for
    the purple hue of a typical almandine. The spectrum varies in strength
    in different stones. Rhodolite (<a href="#Page_214">p. 214</a>), a garnet lying between
    almandine and pyrope, displays the same bands, and indications of them
    may be detected in the spectra of pyropes of high refraction.</p>

    <div class="headingc">SPECIFIC GRAVITY</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT is one of our earliest experiences that different substances of
    the same size have often markedly different weights; thus, there is
    a great difference between wood and iron, and still greater between
    wood and lead. It is usual to say that iron is heavier than wood,
    but the statement is misleading, because it would be possible by
    selecting a large enough piece of wood to find one at least as heavy
    as a particular piece of iron. We have, in fact, to compare equal
    volumes of the two substances, and all ambiguity is removed if we
    speak of relative density or specific gravity—the former term being
    usually applied to liquids and the latter to solids—instead of weight
    or heaviness. The density of water at 4° C. is taken as unity, that
    being the temperature at which it is highest; at other temperatures it
    is somewhat lower, as will be seen from <a href="#TABLE_IX">Table IX</a> given at the end of
    the book. The direct determination of the volume of an irregular solid
    presents almost insuperable difficulty; but, fortunately, for finding
    the specific gravity it is quite unnecessary to know the volume, as
    will be shown when we proceed to consider the methods in use.</p>

  <p>The specific gravity of a stone is a character which is within narrow
    limits constant for each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> species, and is therefore very useful for
    discriminative purposes. It can be determined whatever be the shape
    of the stone, and it is immaterial whether it be transparent or not;
    but, on the other hand, the stone must be unmounted and free from the
    setting.</p>

  <p>The methods for the determination of the specific gravity are of two
    kinds: in the first a liquid is found of the same, or nearly the same,
    density as the stone, and in the second weighings are made and the use
    of an accurate balance is required.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">(1) Heavy Liquids</span></h3>

  <p>Experiment tells us that a solid substance floats in a liquid denser
    than itself, sinks in one less dense, and remains suspended at any
    level in one of precisely the same density. If the stone be only
    slightly less dense than the liquid, it will rise to the surface; if
    it be just as slightly denser, it will as surely sink to the bottom,
    a physical fact which has added so much to the difficulty and danger
    of submarine manœuvring. If then we can find a liquid denser than the
    stone to be tested, and place the latter in it, the stone will float on
    the surface. If we take a liquid which is less dense than the stone and
    capable of mixing with the heavier liquid, and add it to the latter,
    drop by drop, gently stirring so as to assure that the density of
    the combination is uniformly the same throughout, a stage is finally
    reached when the stone begins to move downwards. It has now very nearly
    the density of the liquid, and, if we find by some means this density,
    we know simultaneously the specific gravity of the stone.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

  <p>Various devices and methods are available for ascertaining the density
    of liquids—for instance, Westphal’s balance; but, apart from the
    inconvenience attending such a determination, the density of all
    liquids is somewhat seriously affected by changes in the temperature,
    and it is therefore better to make direct comparison with fragments
    of substances of known specific gravity, which are termed indicators.
    If of two fragments differing slightly in specific gravity one floats
    on the surface of a uniform column of liquid and the other lies at
    the bottom of the tube containing the liquid, we may be certain that
    the density of the liquid is intermediate between the two specific
    gravities. Such a precaution is necessary because, if the liquid be a
    mixture of two distinct liquids, the density would tend to increase
    owing to the greater volatility of the lighter of them, and in any case
    the density is affected by change of temperature. The specific gravity
    of stones is not much altered by variation in the temperature.</p>

  <p>A more convenient variation of this method is to form a diffusion
    column, so that the density increases progressively with the depth.
    If the stone under test floats at a certain level in such a column
    intermediate between two fragments of known specific gravity, its
    specific gravity may be found by elementary interpolation. To form a
    column of this kind the lighter liquid should be poured on to the top
    of the heavier. Natural diffusion gives the most perfect column, but,
    being a lengthy process, it may conveniently be quickened by gently
    shaking the tube, and the column thus formed gives results sufficiently
    accurate for discriminative purposes.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

  <p>By far the most convenient liquid for ordinary use is methylene
    iodide, which has already been recommended for its high refraction.
    It has, when pure, a density at ordinary room-temperatures of 3·324,
    and it is miscible in all proportions with benzol, whose density is
    O·88, or toluol, another hydrocarbon which is somewhat less volatile
    than benzol, and whose density is about the same, namely, 0·86. When
    fresh, methylene iodide has only a slight tinge of yellow, but it
    rapidly darkens on exposure to light owing to the liberation of iodine
    which is in a colloidal form and cannot be removed by filtration.
    The liquid may, however, be easily cleared by shaking it up with any
    substance with which the iodine combines to form an iodide removable
    by filtration. Copper filings answer the purpose well, though rather
    slow in action; mercury may also be used, but is not very satisfactory,
    because a small amount may be dissolved and afterwards be precipitated
    on to the stone under test, carrying it down to the bottom of the tube.
    Caustic potash (potassium hydroxide) is also recommended; in this case
    the operation should preferably be carried out in a special apparatus
    which permits the clear liquid to be drawn off underneath, because
    water separates out and floats on the surface. In Fig. 32 three cut
    stones, a quartz (<i>a</i>), a beryl (<i>b</i>), and a tourmaline (<i>c</i>) are shown
    floating in a diffusion column of methylene iodide and benzol. Although
    the beryl is only slightly denser than the quartz, it floats at a
    perceptibly lower level. These three species are occasionally found as
    yellow stones of very similar tint.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>—Stones of different<br />
    Specific Gravities floating<br />in a Diffusion Column of<br />heavy Liquid.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Various other liquids have been used or proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> for the same
    purpose, of which two may be mentioned. The first of them is a
    saturated solution of potassium iodide and mercuric iodide in water,
    which is known after the discoverer as Sonstadt’s solution. It is a
    clear mobile liquid with an amber colour, having at 12° C. a density
    of 3·085; it may be mixed with water to any extent, and is easily
    concentrated by heating; moreover, it is durable and not subject to
    alteration of any kind; on the other hand, it is highly poisonous and
    cauterizes the skin, not being checked by albumen; it also destroys
    brass-ware by amalgamating the metal. The second is Klein’s solution,
    a clear yellow liquid which has at 15° C. a density of 3·28. It
    consists of the boro-tungstate of cadmium, of which the formula is
    9WO<sub>3</sub>.B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2CdO.2H<sub>2</sub>O + 16Aq, dissolved in water, with which
    it may be diluted. If the salt be heated, it fuses at 75° C. in its
    own water of crystallization to a yellow liquid, very mobile, with a
    density of 3·55. Klein’s solution is harmless, but it cannot compare
    for convenience of manipulation with methylene iodide.</p>

  <p>The most convenient procedure is to have at hand three glass tubes,
    fitted with stoppers or corks, to contain liquids of different
    densities—</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Methylene iodide reduced to 2·7; using as indicators orthoclase
    2·55, quartz 2·66, and beryl 2·74.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) Methylene iodide reduced to 3·1; indicators, beryl 2·74 and
    tourmaline 3·10.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) Methylene iodide, undiluted, 3·32.</p>

  <p>The pure liquid in the last tube should on no account be diluted; but
    the density of the other two liquids may be varied slightly, either
    by adding benzol in order to lower it, or by allowing benzol, which
    has far greater volatility than methylene iodide, to evaporate, or by
    adding methylene iodide, in order to increase it. The density of the
    liquids may be ascertained approximately from the indicators.</p>

  <p>A glance at the table of specific gravities shows that as regards the
    gem-stones methylene iodide is restricted in its application, since
    it can be used to test only moonstone, quartz, beryl, tourmaline, and
    spodumene; opal and turquoise, being amorphous and more or less porous,
    should not be immersed in liquids, lest the appearance of the stone be
    irretrievably injured. Methylene iodide readily serves to distinguish
    the yellow quartz from the true topaz, with which jewellers often
    confuse it, the latter stone sinking in the liquid; again aquamarine
    floats, but the blue topaz, which is often very similar to it, sinks in
    methylene iodide.</p>

  <p>By saturating methylene iodide with iodine and iodoform, we have a
    liquid (<i>d</i>) of density 3·6; a fragment of topaz, 3·55, may be used to
    indicate whether the liquid has the requisite density. Unfortunately
    this saturated solution is so dark as to be almost opaque, and is,
    moreover, very viscous. Its principal use is to distinguish diamond,
    3·535, from the brilliant colourless zircon, with which, apart from
    a test for hardness, it may easily be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> confused. It is easy to see
    whether the stone floats, as it would do if a diamond. To recover a
    stone which has sunk, the only course is to pour off the liquid into
    another tube, because it is far too dark for the position of the stone
    to be seen.</p>

  <p>It is possible to employ a similar method for still denser stones by
    having recourse to Retgers’s salt, silver-thallium nitrate. This double
    salt is solid at ordinary room-temperatures, but has the remarkable
    property of melting at a temperature, 75° C., which is well below the
    point of fusion of either of its constituents, to a clear, mobile
    yellow liquid, which is miscible in any proportion with water, and
    has, when pure, a density of 4·6. The salt may be purchased, or it may
    be prepared by mixing 100 grams of thallium nitrate and 64 grams of
    silver nitrate, or similar proportions, in a little water, and heating
    the whole over a water-bath, keeping it constantly stirred with a
    glass rod until it is liquefied. The two salts must be mixed in the
    correct proportions, because otherwise the mixture might form other
    double salts, which do not melt at so low a temperature. A glance at
    the table of specific gravities shows that Retgers’s salt may be used
    for all the gem-stones with the single exception of zircon (b). There
    are, however, some objections to its use. It is expensive, and, unless
    kept constantly melted, it is not immediately available. It darkens on
    exposure to strong sunlight like all silver salts, stains the skin a
    peculiar shade of purple which is with difficulty removed, and in fact
    only by abrasion of the skin, and, like all thallium compounds, is
    highly poisonous.</p>

  <p>It is convenient to have three tubes, fitted as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> before with stoppers
    or corks, to contain the following liquids, when heated:—</p>

  <p>(<i>e</i>) Silver-thallium nitrate, reduced to 3·5; using as indicators,
    peridot or idocrase 3·40 and topaz 3·53.</p>

  <p>(<i>f</i>) Silver-thallium nitrate, reduced to 4·0; indicators, topaz 3·53
    and sapphire 4·03.</p>

  <p>(<i>g</i>) Silver-thallium nitrate, undiluted, 4·6.</p>

  <p>The tubes must be heated in some form of water-bath; an ordinary glass
    beaker serves the purpose satisfactorily. The pure salt should never be
    diluted; but the density of the contents of tubes (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) may
    be varied at will, water being added in order to lower the density, and
    concentration by means of evaporation or addition of the nitrate being
    employed in order to increase it. To avoid the discoloration of the
    skin, rubber finger-stalls may be used, and the stones should not be
    handled until after they have been washed in warm water. The staining
    may be minimized if the hands be well washed in hot water before being
    exposed to sunlight. It is advisable to warm the stone to be tested
    in a tube containing water beforehand lest the sudden heating develop
    cracks. A piece of platinum, or, failing that, copper wire is of
    service for removing stones from the tubes; a glass rod, spoon-shaped
    at one end, does equally well. It must be noted that although Retgers’s
    salt is absolutely harmless to the ordinary gem-stones—with the
    exception of opal and turquoise, which, as has already been stated,
    being to some extent porous, should not be immersed in liquids—it
    attacks certain substances, for instance, sulphides and cannot be
    applied indiscriminately to minerals.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

  <p>The procedure described above is intended only as a suggestion;
    the method may be varied to any extent at will, depending upon the
    particular requirements. If such tests are made only occasionally, a
    smaller number of tubes may be used. Thus one tube may be substituted
    for the two marked <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the liquid contained in it being
    diluted as required, and a series of indicators may be kept apart in
    small glass tubes. On the other hand, any one having constantly to test
    stones might increase the number of tubes with advantage, and might
    find it useful to have at hand fragments of all the principal species
    in order to make direct comparison.</p>


  <h3>(2) <span class="smcap">Direct Weighing</span></h3>

  <p>The balance which is necessary in both the methods described under this
    head should be capable of giving results accurate to milligrams, <i>i.e.</i>
    the thousandth part of a gram, and consistent with that restriction
    the beam may be as short as possible so as to give rapid swings and
    thus shorten the time taken in the observations. A good assay balance
    answers the purpose admirably. Of course, it is never necessary to wait
    till the balance has come to rest. The mean of the extreme readings of
    the pointer attached to the beam will give the position in which it
    would ultimately come to rest. Thus, if the pointer just touches the
    eighth division on the right-hand side and the second on the other,
    the mean position is the third division on the right-hand side (½(8 −
    2) = 3). Instead of the ordinary form of chemical balance, Westphal’s
    form or Joly’s spring-balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span> may be employed. Weighings are made more
    quickly, but are not so accurate.</p>

  <p>In refined physical work the practice known as double-weighing is
    employed to obviate any slight error there may be in the suspension
    of the balance. A counterpoise which is heavier than anything to be
    weighed is placed in one pan, and weighed. The counterpoise is retained
    in its pan throughout the whole course of the weighings. Any substance
    whose weight is to be found is placed in the other pan, and weights
    added till the balance swings truly again. The difference between
    the two sets of weights evidently gives the weight of the substance.
    Balances, however, are so accurately constructed that for testing
    purposes such refined precautions are not really necessary.</p>

  <p>It is immaterial in what notation the weighings are made, so long as
    the same is used throughout, but the metric system of weights, which
    is in universal use in scientific work, should preferably be employed.
    Jewellers, however, use carat weights, and a subdivision to the base
    2 instead of decimals, the fractions being ½, ¼, ⅛, <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>,
    <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span>, <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub></span>.
    If these weights be employed, it will be necessary to convert these
    fractions into decimals, and write ½ = ·500, ¼ ·250, ⅛ = ·125, <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> =
    ·062, <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> = ·031, <span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub></span> = ·016.</p>

  <h3>(a) <i>Hydrostatic Weighing</i></h3>

  <p>The principle of this method is very simple. The stone, the specific
    gravity of which is required, is first weighed in air and then when
    immersed in water. If <i>W</i> and <i>W´</i> be these weights respectively, then
    <i>W</i> − <i>W´</i> is evidently the weight of the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> displaced by the stone
    and having therefore the same volume as it, and the specific gravity is
    therefore equal to
    <span class="frac"><sup><i>W</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>W</i> − <i>W<sup>r</sup></i></sub></span>.
    </p>

  <p>If the method of double-weighing had been adopted, the formula would
    be slightly altered. Thus, suppose that <i>c</i> corresponds to the
    counterpoise, <i>w</i> and <i>w´</i> to the stone weighed in air and water
    respectively; then we have <i>W</i> = <i>c</i> − <i>w</i> and <i>W´</i> = <i>c</i> − <i>w´</i>, and
    therefore the specific gravity is equal to
    <span class="frac"><sup><i>c</i> − <i>w</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>w´</i> − <i>w</i></sub></span>.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img id="i_073" src="images/i_p073.jpg" width="550" height="327" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>—Hydrostatic Balance.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Some precautions are necessary in practice to assure an accurate
    result. A balance intended for specific gravity work is provided with
    an auxiliary pan (Fig. 33), which hangs high enough up to permit of
    the stone being suspended underneath. The weight of anything used for
    the suspension must, of course, be determined and subtracted from the
    weight found for the stone, both when in air and when in water. A piece
    of fine silk is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> used for suspending the stone in water,
    but it should be avoided, because the water tends to creep up it and
    the error thus introduced affects the first place of decimals in the
    case of a one-carat stone, the value being too high. A piece of brass
    wire shaped into a cage is much to be preferred. If the same cage be
    habitually used, its weight in air and when immersed in water to the
    customary extent in such determinations should be found once for all.</p>

  <p>Care must also be taken to remove all air-bubbles which cling to the
    stone or the cage; their presence would tend to make the value too low.
    The surface tension of water which makes it cling to the wire prevents
    the balance swinging freely, and renders it difficult to obtain a
    weighing correct to a milligram when the wire dips into water. This
    difficulty may be overcome by substituting a liquid such as toluol,
    which has a much smaller surface tension.</p>

  <p>As has been stated above, the density of water at 4° C. is taken as
    unity, and it is therefore necessary to multiply the values obtained
    by the density of the liquid, whatever it be, at the temperature of
    the observation. In Table IX, at the end of the book, are given the
    densities of water and toluol at ordinary room-temperatures. It will be
    noticed that a correct reading of the temperature is far more important
    in the case of toluol.</p>

  <div class="center large mb2"><i>Example of a Hydrostatic Determination of Specific Gravity—</i></div>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="center-text">
      <div>Weight of stone in air&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 1·471 gram</div>
      <div>Weight of stone in water = 1·067&nbsp; &nbsp; „</div>
      <div>Specific gravity&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=
        <span class="frac"><sup>1·471</sup><span>/</span><sub>1·471 − 1·067</sub></span>
        = <span class="frac"><sup>1·471</sup><span>/</span><sub>0·404</sub></span>.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

  <p>Allowing for the density of water at the temperature of the room, which
    was 16° C., the specific gravity is 3·637. Had no such allowance been
    made, the result would have been four units too high in the third place
    of decimals. For discriminative purposes, however, such refinement is
    unnecessary.</p>

  <h3>(b) <i>Pycnometer, or Specific Gravity Bottle</i></h3>

  <p>The specific gravity bottle is merely one with a fairly long neck on
    which a horizontal mark has been scratched, and which is closed by
    a ground glass stopper. The pycnometer is a refined variety of the
    specific gravity bottle. It has two openings: the larger is intended
    for the insertion of the stone and the water, and is closed by a
    stopper through which a thermometer passes, while the other, which is
    exceedingly narrow, is closed by a stopper fitting on the outside, and
    is graduated to facilitate the determination of the height of the water
    in it.</p>

  <p>The stone is weighed as in the previous method. The bottle is then
    weighed, and filled with water up to the mark and weighed again. The
    stone is now introduced into the bottle, and the surplus water removed
    with blotting-paper or otherwise until it is at the same level as
    before, and the bottle with its contents is weighed. Let <i>W</i> be the
    weight of the stone, <i>w</i> the weight of the bottle, <i>W´</i> the weight of
    the bottle and the water contained in it, and <i>W″</i> the weight of the
    bottle when containing the stone and the water. Then <i>W´</i> − <i>w</i> is the
    weight of the water filling the bottle up to the mark, and <i>W″</i> − <i>w</i>
    − <i>W</i> is the reduced weight of water after the stone has been inserted;
    the difference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> <i>W</i> + <i>W´</i> − <i>W″</i>, is the weight of the water
    displaced. The specific gravity is therefore
    <span class="frac"><sup><i>W</i></sup><span>/</span><sub><i>W</i> + <i>W´</i> − <i>W″</i></sub></span>.
    As in the previous method, this value must be multiplied by the density
    of the liquid at the temperature of the experiment. If the method of
    double-weighing be adopted, the formula will be slightly modified.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>Of the above methods, that of heavy liquids, as it is usually termed,
    is by far the quickest and the most convenient for stones of ordinary
    size, the specific gravity of which is less than the density of pure
    methylene iodide, namely, 3·324, and by its aid a value may be obtained
    which is accurate to the second place of decimals, a result quite
    sufficient for a discriminative test. The method is applicable no
    matter how small the stone may be, and, indeed, for very small stones
    it is the only trustworthy method; for large stones it is inconvenient,
    not only because of the large quantity of liquid required, but also
    on account of the difficulty in estimating with sufficient certainty
    the position of the centre of gravity of the stone. A negative
    determination may be of value, especially if attention be paid to the
    rate at which the stone falls through the liquid; the denser the stone
    the faster it will sink, but the rate depends also upon the shape of
    the stone. Retgers’s salt is less convenient because of the delay
    involved in warming it and of the almost inevitable staining of the
    hands, but its use presents no difficulty whatever.</p>

  <p>Hydrostatic weighing is always available, unless the stone be very
    small, but the necessary weighings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> occupy considerable time, and care
    must be taken that no error creeps into the computation, simple though
    it be. Even if everything is at hand, a determination is scarcely
    possible under a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>The third method, which takes even longer, is intended primarily for
    powdered substances, and is not recommended for cut stones, unless
    there happen to be a number of tiny ones which are known to be exactly
    of the same kind.</p>

  <p>The specific gravities of the gem-stones are given in <a href="#TABLE_VII">Table VII</a> at the
    end of the book.</p>

    <div class="headingc">HARDNESS AND CLEAVABILITY</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">EVERY possessor of a diamond ring is aware that diamond easily
    scratches window-glass. If other stones were tried, it would be
    found that they also scratched glass, but not so readily, and, if
    the experiment were extended, it would be found that topaz scratches
    quartz, but is scratched by corundum, which in its turn yields to
    the all-powerful diamond. There is therefore considerable variation
    in the capacity of precious stones to resist abrasion, or, as it is
    usually termed, in their hardness. To simplify the mode of expressing
    this character the mineralogist Mohs about a century ago devised the
    following arbitrary scale, which is still in general use.</p>

  <div class="center large"><span class="smcap">Mohs’s Scale of Hardness</span></div>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="center-text">
    <ol>
      <li>Talc</li>
      <li>Gypsum</li>
      <li>Calcite</li>
      <li>Fluor</li>
      <li>Apatite</li>
      <li>Orthoclase</li>
      <li>Quartz</li>
      <li>Topaz</li>
      <li>Corundum</li>
      <li>Diamond</li>
    </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A finger-nail scratches gypsum and softer substances. Ordinary
    window-glass is slightly softer than orthoclase, and a steel knife is
    slightly harder;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> a hardened file approaches quartz in hardness, and
    easily scratches glass.</p>

  <p>By saying that a stone has hardness 7 we merely mean that it will not
    scratch quartz, and quartz will not scratch it. The numbers indicate
    an order, and have no quantitative significance whatever. This is an
    important point about which mistakes are often made. We must not, for
    instance, suppose that diamond has twice the hardness of apatite.
    As a matter of fact, the interval between diamond and corundum is
    immensely greater than that between the latter and talc, the softest
    of mineral substances. Intermediate degrees of hardness are expressed
    by fractions. The number 8½ for chrysoberyl means that it scratches
    topaz as easily as it itself is scratched by corundum. Pyrope garnet is
    slightly harder than quartz, and its hardness is said therefore to be
    7¼.</p>

  <p>Delicate tests show that the structure of all crystallized substances
    is more or less grained, like that of wood, and the hardness for the
    same stone varies in different directions. Kyanite is unique in this
    respect, since its hardness ranges from 5 to 7; it can therefore
    be scratched by a knife in some directions, but not in others. In
    most substances, however, the range is so small as to be quite
    imperceptible. Slight variation is also apparent in the hardness of
    different specimens of the same species. The diamonds from Borneo and
    New South Wales are so distinctly harder than those from South Africa
    and other localities that, when first discovered, some difficulty was
    experienced in cutting them. Again, lapidaries find that while Ceylon
    sapphires are harder than rubies, Kashmir sapphires are softer.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

  <p>Hardness is a character of fundamental importance in a stone intended
    for ornamental wear, since upon it depends the durability of the polish
    and brilliancy. Ordinary dust is largely composed of grains of sand,
    which is quartz in a minute form, and a gem-stone should therefore
    be at least as hard as that. Paste imitations are little harder than
    5, and consequently, as experience shows, their polish does not
    survive a few weeks’ wear. Hardness is, however, of little use as a
    discriminative test except for distinguishing between topaz or harder
    stone and paste. Diamond is so much harder than other stones that it
    will leave a cut in glass quite different from the scratch of even
    corundum. Paste, being so soft, readily yields to the file, and is thus
    easily distinguished from genuine stones. In applying the test to a
    cut stone, it is best to remove it from its mount and try the effect
    on the girdle, because any scratch would be concealed afterwards by
    the setting. Any mark should be rubbed with the finger to assure that
    it is not due to powder from the scratching agent; confusion may often
    be caused in this way when the two substances are of nearly the same
    hardness.</p>

  <p>The degrees of hardness of the gem-stones are given in <a href="#TABLE_VIII">Table VIII</a> at
    the end of the book.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>It must not be overlooked that extreme hardness is compatible with
    cleavability in certain directions intimately connected with the
    crystalline structure; the property, in fact, characterizes many
    mineral species of different degrees of hardness. Diamond can be split
    in four directions parallel to the faces of the regular octahedron,
    a property utilized by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> lapidary for shaping a stone previous to
    cutting it. Topaz cleaves with considerable ease at right angles to the
    principal crystallographic axis. Felspar has two directions of cleavage
    nearly at right angles to one another. The new gem-stone, kunzite,
    needs cautious handling owing to the facility with which it splits in
    two directions mutually inclined at about 70°.</p>

  <p>All stones are more or less brittle, and will be fractured by a
    sufficiently violent blow, but the irregular surface of a fracture
    cannot be mistaken for the brilliant flat surface given by a cleavage.
    The cleavage is by no means induced with equal facility in the species
    mentioned above. A considerable effort is required to split diamond,
    but in the case of topaz or kunzite incipient cleavage in the shape of
    flaws may be started if the stone be merely dropped on to a hard floor.</p>

    <div class="headingc">ELECTRICAL CHARACTERS</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE definite orientation of the molecular arrangement of crystallized
    substances leads in many cases to attributes which vary with the
    direction and are revealed by the electrical properties. If a
    tourmaline crystal be heated in a gas or alcohol flame it becomes
    charged with electricity, and, since it is at the same time a bad
    conductor, static charges of opposite sign appear at the two ends.
    Topaz shows similar characters, but in a lesser degree. Quartz, if
    treated in the same way, shows charges of opposite sign on different
    sides, but the phenomenon may be masked by intimate twinning and
    consequent overlapping of the contrary areas. The phenomenon may
    also be seen when the stones are cut. The most convenient method for
    detecting the existence of the electrical charges is that devised
    by Kundt. A powder consisting of a mixture of red lead and sulphur
    is placed in a bellows arrangement and blown through a sieve at one
    end on to the stone. Owing to the friction the particles become
    electrified—red lead positively and sulphur negatively—and are
    attracted by the charges of opposing sign, which will therefore be
    betrayed by the colour of the dust at the corresponding spot. The
    powder must be kept dry;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> otherwise a chemical reaction may occur
    leading to the formation of lead sulphide, recognizable by its black
    colour. Bücker has suggested as an alternative the use of sulphur,
    coloured red with carmine, the negative element, and yellow lycopodium,
    the positive element.</p>

  <p>Diamond, topaz, and tourmaline are powerful enough, when electrified
    by friction with a cloth, to attract fragments of paper, the
    electrification being positive. Amber develops considerable negative
    electricity when treated in a similar manner.</p>

  <p>Diamond is translucent to the Röntgen (X) rays; glass, on the other
    hand, is opaque to them, and this test distinguishes brilliants from
    paste imitations. Diamond also, unlike glass, phosphoresces under the
    influence of radium, a property characterizing also kunzite.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the electrical characters, although of
    considerable interest to the student, are, on account of their
    limited application and difficulty of test, of little service for the
    discrimination of gem-stones.</p>

    <div class="headingc">UNIT OF WEIGHT</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE system in use for recording the weights of precious stones is
    peculiar to jewellery. The unit, which is known as the carat, bears no
    simple relation to any unit that has existed among European nations,
    and indubitably has been introduced from the East. When man in early
    days sought to record the weights of small objects, he made use of the
    most convenient seeds or grains which were easily obtainable and were
    at the same time nearly uniform in size. In Europe the smallest unit of
    weight was the barley grain. Similarly in the East the seeds of some
    leguminous tree were selected. Those of the locust-tree, <i>Ceratonia
    siliqua</i>, which is common in the countries bordering the Mediterranean,
    on the average weigh so nearly a carat that they almost certainly
    formed the original unit. It is, indeed, from the Greek <span xml:lang="el">κεράτιον</span>,
    little horn, which refers to the shape of the pods, that the
    word carat is derived.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

  <p>It is one of the eccentricities of the jewellery trade that precision
    should not have been given to the unit of weight. Not only does it
    vary at most of the trade centres in the world, but it is not even
    always constant at each centre. The difference is negligible in the
    case of single stones of ordinary size, but becomes a matter of serious
    importance when large stones, or parcels of small stones, are bought
    and sold, particularly when the stones are very costly. Attempts have
    been made at various times to secure a uniform standard, but as yet
    with only partial success. In 1871 the carat defined as the equivalent
    of 0·20500 gram was suggested at a meeting of the principal jewellers
    of Paris and London, and was eventually accepted in Paris, New York,
    Leipzig, and Borneo. It has, however, recently been recognized that
    in view of the gradual spread of the metric system of weights and
    measures the most satisfactory unit is the metric carat of one-fifth
    (0·2) gram. This has now been constituted the legal carat of France
    and Belgium, and no doubt other countries will follow their example.
    The carat weight obtaining in London weighs about 0·20530 gram, and
    the approximate equivalents in the gram at other centres are as
    follows:—Florence 0·19720, Madrid 0·20539, Berlin 0·20544, Amsterdam
    0·20570, Lisbon 0·20575, Frankfort-on-Main 0·20577, Vienna 0·20613,
    Venice 0·20700, and Madras 0·20735. The gram itself is inconveniently
    large to serve as a unit for the generality of stones met with in
    ordinary jewellery.</p>

  <p>The notation for expressing the sub-multiples of the carat forms
    another curious eccentricity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> Fractions are used which are powers of
    the half: thus the half, the half of that, <i>i.e.</i> the quarter, and so
    on down to the sixty-fourth, and the weight of a stone is expressed
    by a series of fractions, <i>e.g.</i> 3½⅛<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub></span> carats. In the case of
    diamond a single unreduced fraction to the base 64 is substituted in
    place of the series of single fractions, and the weight of a stone is
    stated thus, 4<span class="fraction"><sup>40</sup>/<sub>64</sub></span> carats. With the introduction of the metric
    carat the more convenient and rational decimal notation would, of
    course, be simultaneously adopted.</p>

    Weights.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Figs. 34–39 illustrate the exact sizes of diamonds of certain weights,
    when cut as brilliants. The sizes of other stones depends upon their
    specific gravity, the weight varying as the volume multiplied by the
    specific gravity. Quartz, for instance, has a low specific gravity and
    would be perceptibly larger, weight for weight; zircon, on the other
    hand, would be smaller.</p>

  <p>It has been found more convenient to select a smaller unit in the case
    of pearls, namely, the pearl-grain, four of which go to the carat.</p>

  <p>Stencil gauges are in use for measuring approximately the weight in
    carats of diamond brilliants and of pearls, which in both instances
    must be unmounted. A more accurate method for determining the weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
    of diamonds has been devised by Charles Moe, which is applicable to
    either unmounted or mounted stones. By means of callipers, which read
    to three-tenths of a millimetre, the diameter and the depth of the
    stone are measured, and by reference to a table the corresponding
    weight is found; allowance is made for the varying fineness of the
    girdle, and, in the case of large stones, for the variation from a
    strictly circular section.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>Since this chapter was written the movement in favour of the metric
    carat has made rapid progress, and this unit will soon have been
    adopted as the legal standard all over the world, even in countries,
    such as the British Isles and the United States, where the metric
    system is not in use. The advantage of an international unit is too
    obvious to need arguing.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH many of the gem-stones have been endowed by nature with
    brilliant lustrous faces and display scintillating reflections from
    their surfaces, yet their form is never such as to reveal to full
    perfection the optical qualities upon which their charm depends.
    Moreover, the natural faces are seldom perfect; as a rule the stones
    are broken either through some convulsion of the earth’s crust or in
    course of extraction from the matrix in which they have lain, or they
    are roughened by attrition against matter of greater hardness, or worn
    by the prolonged action of water, or etched by solvents. Beautiful
    octahedra of diamond or spinel have been mounted without further
    embellishment, but even their appearance might have been much improved
    at the lapidary’s hands.</p>

  <p>By far the oldest of the existing styles of cutting is the rounded
    shape known as cabochon, a French word derived from the Latin <i>cabo</i>,
    a head. In the days of the Roman Empire the softer stones were often
    treated in this manner; such stones were supposed to be beneficial
    to those suffering from short-sightedness, the reason no doubt being
    that transparent stones when cut as a double cabochon formed a convex
    lens. According to Pliny, Nero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> had an emerald thus cut, through
    which he was accustomed to view the gladiatorial shows. This style of
    cutting was long a favourite for coloured stones, such as emerald,
    ruby, sapphire, and garnet, but has been abandoned in modern practice
    except for opaque, semi-opaque, and imperfect stones. The crimson
    garnet, which was at one time known by the name carbuncle, was so
    systematically thus cut that the word has come to signify a red garnet
    of this form. It was a popular brooch-stone with our grandmothers, but
    is no longer in vogue. The East still retains a taste for stones cut
    in the form of beads and drilled through the centre; the beads are
    threaded together, and worn as necklaces. The native lapidaries often
    improve the colour of pale emeralds by lining the hole with green paint.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>—Simple Cabochon.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The cabochon form may be of three different kinds. In the first, the
    double cabochon (Fig. 40), both the upper and the under sides of the
    stones are curved. The curvature, however, need not be the same in
    each case; indeed, it is usually markedly different. Moonstones and
    starstones are generally cut very steep above and shallow underneath.
    Occasionally a ruby or a sapphire is, when cut in this way, set with
    the shallow side above, because the light that has penetrated into the
    stone from above is more wholly reflected from a steep surface with
    consequent increase in the glow of colour from the stone. Opals are
    always cut higher on the exposed side, but the slope of the surface
    varies considerably; they are generally cut steeply when required for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
    mounting in rings. Chrysoberyl cat’s-eyes are invariably cut with
    curved bases in order to preserve the weight as great as possible.
    The double cabochon form with a shallow surface underneath merges
    into the second kind (Fig. 41) in which the under side is plane, the
    form commonly employed for quartz cat’s-eyes, and occasionally also
    for carbuncles. In this type the plane side is invariably mounted
    downwards. In the third form (Fig. 42) the curvature of the under
    surface is reversed, and the stone is hollowed out into a concave
    shape. This style is reserved for dark stones, such as carbuncles,
    which, if cut at all thick, would show very little colour. A piece of
    foil is often placed in the hollow in order to increase the reflection
    of light, and thus to heighten the colour effect.</p>

  <p>In early days it was supposed that the extreme hardness of diamond
    precluded the possibility of fashioning it, and up to the fifteenth
    century all that was done was to remove the gum-like skin which
    disfigured the Indian stones and to polish the natural facets.
    The first notable advance was made in 1475, when Louis de Berquem
    discovered, as it is said quite by accident, that two diamonds if
    rubbed together ground each other. With confident courage he essayed
    the new art upon three large stones entrusted to him by Charles the
    Bold, to the entire satisfaction of his patron. The use of wheels
    or discs charged with diamond dust soon followed, but at first the
    lapidaries evinced their victory over such stubborn material by
    grinding diamond into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> divers fantastic shapes, and failed to realize
    how much might be done to enhance the intrinsic beauty of the stones by
    the means now at their disposal. The Indian lapidaries arrived at the
    same discovery independently, and Tavernier found, when visiting the
    country in 1665, a large number of diamond cutters actively employed.
    If the stone were perfectly clear, they contented themselves with
    polishing the natural facets; but if it contained flaws or specks, they
    covered it with numerous small facets haphazardly placed. The stone was
    invariably left in almost its original shape, and no effort was made to
    improve the symmetry.</p>

  </div>

  <p>For a long time little further progress was made, and even nearly a
    century after Berquem the only regular patterns known to Kentmann, who
    wrote in 1562, were the diamond-point and the diamond-table (Figs.
    43–44). The former consisted of the natural octahedron facets ground
    to regular shape, and was long employed for the minute stones which
    were set in conjunction with large coloured stones in rings. The table
    represented considerably greater labour. One corner of the regular
    octahedron was ground down until the artificial facet thus produced was
    half the width of the stone, while the opposite corner was slightly
    ground.</p>

  <p>Still another century elapsed before the introduction of the rose
    pattern, which comprised twenty-four triangular facets and a flat base
    (Figs. 45–46), the stone being nearly hemispherical in shape. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
    style is said to have been the invention of Cardinal Mazarin, but
    probably he was the first to have diamonds of any considerable size cut
    in this form. At the present day only tiny stones are cut as roses.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A few more years passed away, and at length at the close of the
    seventeenth century diamond came by its own when Vincenzio Peruzzi, a
    Venetian, introduced the brilliant form of cutting, and revealed for
    the first time its amazing ‘fire.’ Except for minor changes this form
    remains to this day the standard style for the shape of diamond, and
    the word brilliant is commonly employed to denote diamond cut in this
    way. So obviously and markedly superior is the style to all others
    that upon its discovery the owners of large roses had them re-cut as
    brilliants despite the loss in weight necessitated by the change.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <div class="center"><img id="i_092b" src="images/i_p092b.jpg" width="130" height="61" alt="" /></div>
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>—Rose<br />Cut (side view).</div>
  </div>

  <p>The brilliant form is derived from the old table by increasing the
    number of facets and slightly altering the angles pertaining to the
    natural octahedron. In a perfect brilliant (Figs. 47–49) there are
    altogether 58 facets, 33 above and 25 below the girdle, as the edge
    separating the upper and lower portions of the stone is termed, which
    are arranged in the following manner. Eight star-facets, triangular
    in shape, immediately surround the large table-facet. Next come four
    large templets or bezels, quadrilateral in form, arranged in pairs
    on opposite sides of the table-facet, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> four quoins or lozenges,
    similar in shape, coming intermediately between them; in modern
    practice, however, these two sets are identical in shape and size,
    and there are consequently eight facets of the same kind instead of
    two sets of four. The eight cross or skew facets and the eight skill
    facets, in both sets the shape being triangular, form the boundary
    of the girdle; modern brilliants usually have instead sixteen facets
    of the same shape and size. The above 33 facets lie above the girdle
    and form the crown of the stone. Immediately opposite and parallel to
    the table is the tiny culet. Next to the latter come the four large
    pavilion facets with the four quoins intermediately between them,
    both sets being five-sided but nearly quadrilateral in shape; these
    again are usually combined into eight facets of the same size. Eight
    cross facets and eight skill facets, both sets, like those in the
    crown, being triangular in shape, form the lower side of the girdle;
    these also are generally united into a set of sixteen similar facets.
    These 25 facets which lie below the girdle comprise the ‘pavilion,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
    or base of the stone. In a regular stone properly cut a templet is
    nearly parallel to a pavilion, and an upper to a lower cross facet. The
    contour of the girdle is usually circular, but occasionally assumes
    less symmetrical shapes, as for instance in drop-stones or pendeloques,
    and the facets are at the same time distorted. The number of facets may
    with advantage be increased in the case of large stones. An additional
    set of eight star facets is often placed round the culet, the total
    number then being 66. It may be mentioned that the largest stone cut
    from the Cullinan has the exceptional number of 74 facets.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In order to secure the finest optical effect certain proportions have
    been found necessary. The depth of the crown must be one-half that of
    the base, and therefore one-third the total depth of the stone, and the
    width of the table must be slightly less than half that of the stone.
    The culet should be quite small, not more in width than one-sixth of
    the table; it is, in fact, not required at all except to avoid the
    danger of the point splintering. The girdle should be as thin as is
    compatible with strength sufficient to prevent chipping in the process
    of mounting the stone; if it were left thick, the rough edge would be
    visible by reflection at the lower facets, and would, especially if at
    all dirty, seriously affect the quality of the stone. The shape of the
    stone is largely determined by the sizes of the templets in the crown
    and the pavilions in the base as compared with that of the table, or,
    what comes to the same thing, by the inclinations at which they are cut
    to that facet. If the table had actually half the width of the stone,
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> angle<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> between it and a templet would be exactly half a right
    angle or 45°; it is, however, made somewhat smaller, namely, about 40°.
    A pavilion, being parallel to a templet, makes a similar angle with the
    culet. The cross facets are more steeply inclined, and make an angle
    of about 45° with the table or the culet, as the case may be. The star
    facets, on the other hand, slant perceptibly less, and make an angle of
    only about 26° with the table. A latitude of some 4° or 5° is possible
    without seriously affecting the ‘fire’ of the stone.</p>

  <p>The object of the disposition of the facets on a brilliant is to assure
    that all the light that enters the stone, principally by way of the
    table, is wholly reflected from the base and emerges through the crown,
    preferably by way of the inclined facets. A brilliant-cut diamond, if
    viewed with the table between the observer and the light, appears quite
    dark except for the small amount of light escaping through the culet.
    Light should therefore fall on the lower facets at angles greater
    than the critical angle of total-reflection, which for diamond is 24°
    26´. The pavilions should be inclined properly at double this angle,
    or 48° 52´, to the culet; but a ray that emerges at a pavilion in the
    actual arrangement entered the table at nearly grazing incidence, and
    the amount of light entering this facet at such acute perspective is
    negligible. On the other hand, after reflection at the base light must,
    in order to emerge, fall on the crown at less than the critical angle
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>of total-reflection. In Fig. 50 are shown diagrammatically the paths
    of rays that entered the table in divers ways. The ray emerging again
    at the table suffers little or no dispersion and is almost white,
    but those coming out through the inclined facets are split up into
    the rainbow effect, known as ‘fire,’ for which diamond is so famous.
    It is in order that so much of the light entering by the table may
    emerge through the inclined facets of the crown that the pavilions are
    inclined at not much more than 40° to the culet. It might be suggested
    that instead of being faceted the stone should be conically shaped,
    truncated above and nearly complete below. The result would no doubt
    be steadier, but, on the other hand, far less pleasing. It is the
    ever-changing nuance that chiefly attracts the eye; now a brilliant
    flash of purest white, anon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> a gleam of cerulean blue, waxing to
    richest orange and dying in a crimson glow, all intermingled with the
    manifold glitter from the surface of the stone. Absolute cleanliness is
    essential if the full beauty of any stone is to be realized, but this
    is particularly true of diamond. If the back of the stone be clogged
    with grease and dirt, as so often happens in claw-set rings, light is
    no longer wholly reflected from the base; much of it escapes, and the
    amount of ‘fire’ is seriously diminished.</p>

    through a Brilliant.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Needless to state, lapidaries make no careful angular measurements
    when cutting stones, but judge of the position of the facets entirely
    by eye. It sometimes therefore happens that the permissible limits
    are overstepped, in which event the stone is dead and may resist all
    efforts to vivify it short of the heroic course of re-cutting it, too
    expensive a treatment in the case of small stones.</p>

  <p>The factors that govern the properties of a brilliant-cut stone are
    large colour-dispersion, high refraction, and freedom from any trace of
    intrinsic colour. The only gem-stone that can vie with diamond in these
    respects is zircon. Although it is rare to find a zircon naturally
    without colour, yet many kinds are easily deprived of their tint by
    the application of heat. A brilliant-cut zircon is, indeed, far from
    readily distinguished by eye from diamond, and has probably often
    passed as one, but it may easily be identified by its large double
    refraction (cf. <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>) and inferior hardness. The remaining colourless
    stones, such as white sapphire, topaz, and quartz (rock-crystal), have
    insufficient refractivity to give total-reflection at the base, and,
    moreover, they are comparatively deficient in ‘fire.’</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>—Step- or Trap-Cut (side view).</div>
  </div>

  <p>A popular style of cutting which is much in vogue for coloured stones
    is the step- or trap-cut, consisting of a table and a series of
    facets with parallel horizontal edges (Figs. 51–52) above and below
    the girdle; in recent jewellery, however, the top of the stone is
    often brilliant-cut. The contour may be oblong, square, lozenge, or
    heart-shaped, or have less regular forms. The table is sometimes
    slightly rounded. Since the object of this style is primarily to
    display the intrinsic colour of the stone and not so much a brilliant
    play of light from the interior, no attempt is made to secure
    total-reflection at the lower facets. The stone therefore varies in
    depth according to its tint; if dark, it is cut shallow, lest light
    be wholly absorbed within, and the stone appear practically opaque,
    but if light, it is cut deep, in order to secure fullness of tint.
    Much precision in shape and disposition of the facets is not demanded,
    and the stones are usually cut in such a way that, provided the
    desired effect is obtained, the weight is kept as great as possible;
    we may recall that stones are sold by weight. In considering what
    will be the optical effect of any particular shape, regard must be
    had to the effective colour of the transmitted light. For instance,
    although sapphire and ruby belong to the same species and have the
    same refractive indices, yet, since the former transmits mainly blue
    and the latter red light, they have for practical purposes appreciably
    different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> indices, and lapidaries find it therefore possible to cut
    the base of ruby thicker than that of sapphire, and thus keep the
    weight greater. It is instructive too what can be done with the most
    unpromising material by the exercise of a little ingenuity. Thus Ceylon
    sapphires are often so irregularly coloured that considerable skill
    is called for in cutting them. A stone may, for instance, be almost
    colourless except for a single spot of blue; yet, if the stone be
    cut steeply and the spot be brought to the base, the effect will be
    precisely the same as if the stone were uniformly coloured, because all
    the light emerging from the stone has passed through the spot at the
    base and therefore been tinted blue.</p>

  <p>The mechanism employed in the fashioning of gem-stones is simple in
    character, and comprises merely metal plates or wheels for slitting,
    and discs or laps for grinding and polishing the stones, the former
    being set vertically and rotated about horizontal spindles, and the
    latter set horizontally and rotated about vertical spindles. Mechanical
    power is occasionally used for driving both kinds of apparatus, but
    generally, especially in slitting and in delicate work, hand-power is
    preferred. In the East native lapidaries make use of vertical wheels
    (<a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>) also for grinding and polishing stones, which explains why
    native-cut stones never have truly plane facets; it will be noticed
    from the picture that a long bow is used to drive the spindle.</p>

  <p>Owing to the unique hardness of diamond it can be fashioned only by
    the aid of its own powder. The process differs therefore materially
    from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> cutting of the remaining gem-stones, and will be described
    separately. Indeed, so different are the two classes of work that firms
    seldom habitually undertake both.</p>

  <p>The discovery of the excellent cleavage of diamond enormously reduced
    the labour of cutting large stones. A stone containing a bad flaw may
    be split to convenient shape in as many minutes as the days or even
    weeks required to grind it down. The improvement in the appliances and
    the provision of ample mechanical power has further accelerated the
    process and reduced the cost. Two years were occupied in cutting the
    diamond known as the Pitt or Regent, whereas in only six months the
    colossal Cullinan was shaped into two large and over a hundred smaller
    stones with far less loss of material.</p>

  <p>Although the brilliant form was derived from the regular octahedron, it
    by no means follows that, because diamond can be cleaved to the latter
    form, such is the initial step in fashioning the rough mass. The aim of
    the lapidary is to cut the largest possible stone from the given piece
    of rough, and the finished brilliant usually bears no relation whatever
    to the natural octahedron. The cleavage is utilized only to free the
    rough of an awkward and useless excrescence, or of flaws. Although the
    octahedron is one of the common forms in which diamond is found, it is
    rarely regular, and oftener than not one of the larger faces is made
    the table.</p>

  <p>The old method, which is still in use, for roughly fashioning diamonds
    is that known as bruting, from the French word, <i xml:lang="fr">brutage</i>, for the
    process, or as shaping. Two stones of about the same size are selected,
    and are firmly attached by means of a hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> cement to the ends of
    two holders, which are held one in each hand, and rubbed hard, one
    against the other, until surfaces of the requisite size are developed
    on each stone. During the process the stones are held over a small
    box, which catches the precious powder. A fine sieve at the bottom
    of the box allows the powder to fall through into a tray underneath,
    but holds back anything larger. By means of two vertical pins placed
    one on each side of the box the holders are retained more easily in
    the desired position, and the work is thrown mainly on the thumbs.
    This work continued day after day has a very disfiguring effect upon
    the hands despite the thick gloves that are worn to protect them; the
    skin of the thumbs grows hard and horny, and the first and second
    fingers become swollen and distorted. When the surfaces have thus been
    formed, the stone is handed to the polisher, who works them into the
    correct shape and afterwards polishes them, the stone passing backwards
    and forwards several times between the cutter and the polisher. The
    table, four templets, culet and four pavilions are first formed and
    polished, so that the table has a square shape. Next the quoins are
    developed and polished, and finally the small facets are polished on,
    not being shaped first. In modern practice the process of bruting has
    been modified in some cases by the introduction of machinery, and the
    facets are ground on, with considerable improvement in the regularity
    of their size and disposition, and reduction in the amount of polishing
    required. Moreover, to obviate the loss of material resulting from
    continued grinding, large stones are first sliced by means of
    rapidly-revolving copper wheels charged with diamond powder.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

  <p>The laps used for polishing diamonds are made of a particular kind
    of soft iron, which is found to surpass any other metal in retaining
    the diamond powder. They are rotated at a high rate of speed, which
    is about 2000 to 2500 revolutions a minute, and the heat developed by
    the friction at this speed is too great for a cement to be used; a
    solder or fusible alloy, composed of one part tin to three parts lead,
    therefore takes its place. The solder is held in a hollow cup of brass
    which is from its shape called a ‘dop,’ an old Dutch word meaning
    shell. Its external diameter is ordinarily about 1½ in. (4 cm.), but
    larger dops are, of course, used for large stones. A stout copper stalk
    is attached to the bottom of the dop; it is visible in the view of the
    dop shown at <i>e</i> on <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI</a>, and two slabs of solder are seen lying in
    front of the dop. The dop containing the solder is placed in the midst
    of a non-luminous flame and heated until the solder softens, when it is
    removed by means of the small tongs, <i>c</i>, and placed upright on a stand
    such as that shown at <i>a</i>. The long tongs, <i>d</i>, are used for shaping
    the solder into a cone at the apex of which the diamond is placed. The
    solder is worked well over the stone so that only the part to undergo
    polishing is exposed. A diamond in position is shown at <i>f</i>. The top of
    the stand is saucer-shaped to catch the stone should it accidentally
    fall off the dop, and to prevent pieces of solder falling on the hand.
    While still hot, the dop with the diamond in position on the solder is
    plunged into cold water in order to cool it. The fact that the stone
    withstands this drastic treatment is eloquent testimony to its good
    thermal conductivity; other gem-stones would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span> promptly split into
    fragments. It may be remarked that so high is the temperature at which
    diamond burns that it may be placed in the gas flame without any fear
    of untoward results. The dop is now ready for attachment to an arm
    such as that shown at <i>b</i>; the stalk of the dop is placed in a groove
    running across the split end of the arm, and is gripped tight by means
    of a screw worked by the nut which is visible in the picture.</p>

  <p>Four such arms, each with a dop, are used with the polishing lap (<a href="#Plate_VII">Plate
    VII</a>), and each stands on two square legs on the bench. Pins, <i>p</i>, in
    pairs are fixed to the bench to prevent the arms being carried round by
    the friction; one near the lap holds the arm not far from the dop, and
    the other engages in a strong metal tongue, which is best seen at the
    end of the arm <i>b</i> on <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI</a>. Though the arm, which is made of iron,
    is heavy, yet for polishing purposes it is insufficient, and additional
    lead weights are laid on the top of it, as in the case of the arm
    at the back on <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>. The copper stalk is strong, yet flexible,
    and can be bent to suit the position of the facet to be polished; on
    <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a> the dops <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are upright, but the other two are
    inclined. In addition to the powder resulting from bruting, boart,
    <i>i.e.</i> diamonds useless for cutting, are crushed up to supply polishing
    material, and a little olive oil is used as a lubricant. Owing to the
    friction so much heat is developed that even the solder would soften
    after a time, and therefore, as a precaution, the dop is from time
    to time cooled by immersion in water. The stone has constantly to be
    re-set, about six being the maximum even of the tiny facets near the
    girdle that can be dealt with by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> varying the inclination of the dop.
    As the work approaches completion the stone is frequently inspected,
    lest the polishing be carried too far for the development of the proper
    amount of ‘fire.’ When finished, the stones are boiled in sulphuric
    acid to remove all traces of oil and dirt.</p>

  <p>The whole operation is evidently rough and ready in the extreme; but
    such amazing skill do the lapidaries acquire, that even the most
    careful inspection by eye alone would scarce detect any want of proper
    symmetry in a well-cut stone.</p>

  <p>The fashioning of coloured stones, as all the gem-stones apart from
    diamond are termed in the jewellery trade, is on account of their
    inferior hardness a far less tedious operation. They are easily
    slit, for which purpose a vertical wheel (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a>) made of soft
    iron is used; it is charged with diamond dust and lubricated with
    oil, generally paraffin. When slit to the desired size, the stone is
    attached to a conveniently shaped holder by means of a cement, the
    consistency of which varies with the hardness of the stone. It is
    set in the cement in such a way that the plane desired for the table
    facet is at right angles to the length of the holder, and the whole of
    the upper part or crown is finished before the stone is removed from
    the cement. The lower half or base is treated in a similar manner.
    Thus in the process of grinding and polishing the stone is only once
    re-set; as was stated above, diamond demands very different treatment.
    Again, all coloured stones are ground down without any intermediate
    operation corresponding to bruting. The holder is merely held in the
    hand, but to maintain its position more exactly its other end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
    which is pointed, is inserted in one of the holes that are pierced at
    intervals in a vertical spindle placed at a convenient distance from
    the lap (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a>), which one depending upon the inclination of the
    facet to be formed. For hard stones, such as ruby and sapphire, diamond
    powder is generally used as the abrasive agent, while for the softer
    stones emery, the impure corundum, is selected; in recent years the
    artificially prepared carborundum, silicide of carbon corresponding to
    the formula CSi, which is harder than corundum, has come into vogue
    for grinding purposes, but it is unfortunately useless for slitting,
    because it refuses to cling to the wheel. To efface the scratches left
    by the abrasive agent and to impart a brilliant polish to the facets,
    material of less hardness, such as putty-powder, pumice, or rouge, is
    employed; in all cases the lubricant is water. The grinding laps are
    made of copper, gun-metal, or lead; and pewter or wooden laps, the
    latter sometimes faced with cloth or leather, are used for polishing.
    As a general rule, the harder the stone the greater the speed of the
    lap.</p>

    <div class="caption">FACETING MACHINE</div>
  </div>

  <p>As in the case of diamond, the lapidary judges of the position of the
    facet entirely by eye and touch, but a skilled workman can develop
    a facet very close to the theoretical position. During recent years
    various devices have been invented to enable him to do his work with
    greater facility. A machine of this kind is illustrated on <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX</a>.
    The stone is attached by means of cement to the blunt end, <i>d</i>, of
    the holder, <i>b</i>, which is of the customary kind, while the other end
    is inserted in a hole in a wooden piece, <i>a</i>, which is adjustable in
    height by means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> the screw above it. The azimuthal positions of the
    facets are arranged by means of the octagonal collar, <i>c</i>, the sides
    of which are held successively in turn against the guide, <i>e</i>. The
    stand itself is clamped to the bench. The machine is, however, little
    used except for cheap stones, because it is too accurate and leads to
    waste of material. Stones are sold by weight, and so long as the eye is
    satisfied, no attempt is made to attain to absolute symmetry of shape.</p>

  <p>The pictures on <a href="#Plate_X">Plates X–XIII</a> illustrate lapidaries’ workshops in
    various parts of the world. The first two show an office and a workshop
    situated in Hatton Garden, London; in the former certain of the staff
    are selecting from the parcels stones suitable for cutting. The third
    depicts a more primitive establishment at Ekaterinburg in the Urals.
    The fourth shows a typical French family—<i xml:lang="fr">père</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">mère</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">et fils</i>—in
    the Jura district, all busily engaged; on the table will be noticed a
    faceting machine of the kind described above. In the fifth picture a
    native lapidary in Calcutta is seen at work with the driving bow in his
    right, and the stone in his left, hand.</p>

  <p>A curious difference exists in the systems of charging for cutting
    diamonds and coloured stones. The cost of cutting the latter is
    reckoned by the weight of the finished stone, the rate varying from
    1s. to 8s. a carat according to the character of the stone and the
    difficulty of the work; while in the case of diamonds, on the other
    hand, the weight of the rough material determines the cost, the rate
    being about 10s. to 40s. a carat according to the size, which on the
    average is equivalent to about 30s. to 120s. a carat calculated on
    the weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> of the finished stone. The reason of the distinction is
    obviously because the proper proportions in a brilliant-cut diamond
    must be maintained, whatever be the loss in weight involved; in
    coloured stones the shape is not of such primary importance.</p>

  <p>When finished, the stone finds its way with others akin to it to the
    manufacturing jeweller’s establishment, where it is handed to the
    setter, who mounts it in a ring, necklace, brooch, or whatever article
    of jewellery it is intended for. The metal used in the groundwork of
    the setting is generally gold, but platinum is also employed where an
    unobtrusive and untarnishable metal is demanded, and silver finds a
    place in cheaper jewellery, although it is seriously handicapped by
    its susceptibility to the blackening influence of the sulphurous fumes
    present in the smoke-laden atmosphere of towns. The stone may be either
    embedded in the metal or held by claws. The former is by far the safer,
    but the latter the more elegant, and it has the advantage of exposing
    the stone <i xml:lang="fr">à jour</i>, to use the French jewellers’ expression, so that
    its genuineness is more evidently testified. It is very important
    that the claw setting be periodically examined, lest the owner one
    day experience the mortification of finding that a valuable stone has
    dropped out; gold, owing to its softness, wears away in course of time.</p>

  <p>Up to quite recent years modern jewellery was justly open to the
    criticism that it was lacking in variety, that little attempt was made
    to secure harmonious association in either the colour or the lustre of
    the gem-stones, and that the glitter of the gold mount was frequently
    far too obtrusive. Gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> consorts admirably with the rich glow of
    ruby, but is quite unsuited to the gleaming fire of a brilliant. Where
    the metal is present merely for the mechanical purpose of holding the
    stones in position, it should be made as little noticeable as possible.
    The artistic treatment of jewellery is, however, receiving now adequate
    attention in the best Paris and London houses. Some recent designs are
    illustrated on <a href="#Plate_IV">Plates IV and V</a>.</p>

    <div class="headingc">NOMENCLATURE OF PRECIOUS STONES</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE names in popular use for the principal gem-stones may be traced
    back to very early times, and, since they were applied long before
    the determinative study of minerals had become a science, their
    significance has varied at different dates, and is even now far from
    precise. No ambiguity or confusion could arise if jewellers made use
    of the scientific names for the species, but most of them are unknown
    or at least unfamiliar to those unversed in mineralogy, and to banish
    old-established names is undesirable, even if the task were not
    hopeless. The name selected for a gem-stone may have a very important
    bearing on its fortunes. When the love-sick Juliet queried ‘What’s
    in a name?’ her mind was wandering far from jewels; for them a name
    is everything. The beautiful red stones that accompany the diamond
    in South Africa were almost a drug in the market under their proper
    title—garnet, but command a ready sale under the misnomer ‘Cape-ruby.’
    To many minds there is a subtle satisfaction in the possession of a
    stone which is assumed to be a sort of ruby that would be destroyed by
    the knowledge that the stone really belonged to the cinderella species
    of gem-stones—the despised garnet. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> similar reasons it was deemed
    advisable to offer the lustrous green garnet found some thirty and odd
    years ago in the Ural Mountains as ‘olivine,’ not a happy choice since
    their colour is grass- rather than olive-green, apart from the fact
    that the term is in general use in science for the species known in
    jewellery as peridot.</p>

  <p>The names employed in jewellery are largely based upon the colour, the
    least reliable from a determinative point of view of all the physical
    characters of gem-stones. Qualifying terms are employed to distinguish
    stones of obviously different hardness. ‘Oriental’ distinguishes
    varieties of corundum, but does not imply that they necessarily came
    from the East; the finest gem-stones originally reached Europe by that
    road, and the hardest coloured stones consequently received that term
    of distinction.</p>

  <p>Nearly all red stones are grouped under the name ruby, which is derived
    from a Latin word, <i xml:lang="la">ruber</i>, meaning red, or under other names adapted
    from it, such as rubellite, rubicelle. It is properly applied to red
    corundum; ‘balas’ ruby is spinel, which is associated with the true
    ruby at the Burma mines and is similar in appearance to it when cut,
    and ‘Cape’ ruby, is, as has been stated above, a garnet from South
    Africa. Rubellite is the lovely rose-pink tourmaline, fine examples of
    which have recently been discovered in California, and rubicelle is a
    less pronouncedly red spinel. Sapphire is by far the oldest and one
    of the most interesting of the words used in the language of jewels.
    It occurs in Hebrew and Persian, ancient tongues, and means blue.
    It was apparently employed for lapis lazuli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> or similar substance,
    but was transferred to the blue corundum upon the discovery of this
    splendid stone. Oblivious of the real meaning of the word, jewellers
    apply it in a quasi-generic sense to all the varieties of corundum
    with the exception of the red ruby, and give vent to such incongruous
    expressions as ‘white sapphire,’ ‘yellow sapphire’; it is true such
    stones often contain traces of blue colour, but that is not the reason
    of the terms. ‘Brazilian’ sapphire is blue tourmaline, a somewhat rare
    tint for this species. The curious history of the word topaz will be
    found below in the chapter dealing with the species of that name. It
    has always denoted a yellow stone, and at the present day is applied
    by jewellers indiscriminately to the true topaz and citrine, the
    yellow quartz, the former, however, being sometimes distinguished by
    the prefix ‘Brazilian.’ ‘Oriental’ topaz is corundum, and ‘occidental’
    topaz is a term occasionally employed for the yellow quartz. Emerald,
    which means green, was first used for chrysocolla, an opaque greenish
    stone (<a href="#Page_288">p. 288</a>), but was afterwards applied to the priceless green
    variety of beryl, for which it is still retained. ‘Oriental’ emerald
    is corundum, ‘Brazilian’ emerald in the eighteenth century was a
    common term for the green tourmaline recently introduced to Europe,
    and ‘Uralian’ emerald has been tentatively suggested for the green
    garnet more usually known as ‘olivine.’ Amethyst is properly the violet
    quartz, but with the prefix ‘oriental’ it is also applied to violet
    corundum, though some jewellers use it for the brilliant quartz, with
    purple and white sectors, from Siberia. Almandine, which is derived
    from the name of an Eastern mart for precious stones, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> come to
    signify a stone of columbine-red hue, principally garnet, but with
    suitable qualification corundum and spinel also.</p>

  <p>The nomenclature of jewellery tends to suggest relations between the
    gem-stones for which there is no real foundation, and to obscure
    the essential identity, except from the point of view of colour, of
    sapphire and ruby, emerald and aquamarine, cairngorm and amethyst.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE initial step in the examination of a crystallized substance is
    to determine its physical characters and to resolve it by chemical
    analysis into its component elements; the final, and by far the
    hardest, step is to build it up or synthetically prepare it from its
    constituents. Unknown to the world at large, work of the latter kind
    has long been going on within the walls of laboratories, and as the
    advance in knowledge placed in the hands of experimenters weapons more
    and more comparable with those wielded by nature, their efforts have
    been increasingly successful. So stupendous, however, are the powers
    of nature that the possibility of reproducing, by human agency, the
    treasured stones which are extracted from the earth in various parts
    of the globe at the cost of infinite toil and labour has always been
    derided by those ignorant of what had already been accomplished. Great,
    therefore, was the consternation and the turmoil when concrete evidence
    that could not be gainsaid showed that man’s restless efforts to
    bridle nature to his will were not in vain, and congresses of all the
    high-priests of jewellery were hastily convened to ban such unrighteous
    products, with what ultimate success remains to be seen.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <p>Crystallization may be caused in four different ways, of which the
    second alone has as yet yielded stones large enough to be cut—</p>

  <p>1. By the separation of the substance from a saturated solution. In
    nature the solvent may not be merely hot water, or water charged with
    an acid, but molten rock, and the temperature and the pressure may be
    excessively high.</p>

  <p>2. By the solidification of the liquefied substance upon cooling. Ice
    is a familiar example of this type.</p>

  <p>3. By the sublimation of the vapour of the substance, which means the
    direct passage from the vapour to the solid state without traversing
    the usually intervening liquid state. It is usually the most difficult
    of attainment of the four methods; the most familiar instance is snow.</p>

  <p>4. By the precipitation of the substance from a solution when set free
    by chemical action.</p>

  <p>Other things being equal, the simpler the composition the greater is
    the ease with which a substance may be expected to be formed; for,
    instead of one complex substance, two or more different substances
    may evolve, unless the conditions are nicely arranged. Attempts,
    for instance, to produce beryl might result instead in a mixture of
    chrysoberyl, phenakite, and quartz.</p>

  <p>By far the simplest in composition of all the precious stones is
    diamond, which is pure crystallized carbon; but its manufacture is
    attended by well-nigh insuperable difficulties. If carbon be heated
    in air, it burns at a temperature well below its melting point;
    moreover, unless an enormously high pressure is simultaneously applied,
    the product<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> is the other form of crystallized carbon, namely, the
    comparatively worthless graphite. Moissan’s interesting course of
    experiments were in some degree successful, but the tiny diamonds were
    worthless as jewels, and the expense involved in their manufacture was
    out of all proportion to any possible commercial value they might have.</p>

  <p>Next to diamond the simplest substances among precious stones are
    quartz (crystallized silica) and corundum (crystallized alumina). The
    crystallization of silica has been effected in several ways, but the
    value in jewellery of quartz, even of the violet variety, amethyst, is
    not such as to warrant its manufacture on a commercial scale. Corundum,
    on the other hand, is held in high esteem; rubies and sapphires, of
    good colour and free from flaws, have always commanded good prices. The
    question of their production by artificial means has therefore more
    than academic interest.</p>

  <p>Ever since the year 1837, when Gaudin produced a few tiny flakes,
    French experimenters have steadily prosecuted their researches in the
    crystallization of corundum. Frémy and Feil, in 1877, were the first
    to meet with much success. A portion of one of their crucibles lined
    with glistening ruby flakes is exhibited in the British Museum (Natural
    History).</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>—Verneuil’s<br />Inverted Blowpipe.</div>
  </div>

  <p>In 1885 the jewellery market was completely taken by surprise by the
    appearance of red stones, emanating, so it is alleged, from Geneva;
    having the physical characters of genuine rubies, they were accepted
    as, and commanded the prices of, the natural stones. It was eventually
    discovered that they had resulted from the fusion of a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
    fragments of natural rubies in the oxy-hydrogen flame. The original
    colour was driven off at that high temperature, but was revived by the
    previous addition of a little bichromate of potassium. Owing to the
    inequalities of growth, the cracks due to rapid cooling, the inclusion
    of air-bubbles, often so numerous as to cause a cloudy appearance,
    and, above all, the unnatural colour, these reconstructed stones, as
    they are termed, were far from satisfactory, but yet they marked such
    an advance on anything that had been accomplished before that for some
    time no suspicion was aroused as to their being other than natural
    stones.</p>

  <p>A notable advance in the synthesis of corundum, particularly of ruby,
    was made in 1904, when Verneuil, who had served his apprenticeship
    to science under the guidance of Frémy, invented his ingenious
    inverted form of blowpipe (Fig. 53), which enabled him to overcome the
    difficulties that had baffled earlier investigators, and to manufacture
    rubies vying in appearance after cutting with the best of nature’s
    productions. The blowpipe consisted of two tubes, of which the upper,
    <i>E</i>, wide above, was constricted below, and passing down the centre of
    the lower, <i>F</i>, terminated just above the orifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> of the latter in
    a fine nozzle. Oxygen was admitted at <i>C</i> through the plate covering
    the upper end of the tube, <i>E</i>. A rod, which passed through a rubber
    collar in the same plate, supported inside the tube, <i>E</i>, a vessel,
    <i>D</i>, and at the upper end terminated in a small plate, on which was
    fixed a disc, <i>B</i>. The hammer, <i>A</i>, when lifted by the action of an
    electromagnet and released, fell by gravity and struck the disc. The
    latter could be turned about a horizontal axis placed eccentrically,
    so that the height through which the hammer fell and the consequent
    force of the blow could be regulated. The rubber collar, which was
    perfectly gas-tight, held the rod securely, but allowed the shocks to
    be transmitted to the vessel, <i>D</i>, an arrangement of guides maintaining
    the slight motion of the vessel strictly vertical. This vessel, which
    carried the alumina powder used in the manufacture of the stone, had as
    its base a cylindrical sieve of fine mesh. The succession of rapid taps
    of the hammer caused a regular feed of powder down the tube, the amount
    being regulated by varying the height through which the hammer fell.
    Hydrogen or coal-gas was admitted at <i>G</i> into the outer tube, <i>F</i>, and
    in the usual way met the oxygen just above the orifice, <i>L</i>. To exclude
    irregular draughts, the flame was surrounded by a screen, <i>M</i>, which
    was provided with a mica window, and a water-jacket, <i>K</i>, protected the

  <p>The alumina was precipitated from a solution of pure ammonia—alum,
    (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24H<sub>2</sub>O, in distilled water
    by the addition of pure ammonia, sufficient chrome-alum also being
    dissolved with the ammonia-alum to furnish about 2½ per cent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> of
    chromic oxide in the resulting stone. The powder, carefully prepared
    and purified, was placed, as has been stated above, in the vessel,
    <i>D</i>, and on reaching the flame at the orifice it melted, and fell
    as a liquid drop, <i>N</i>, upon the pedestal, <i>P</i>, which was formed of
    previously fused alumina. This pedestal was attached by a platinum
    sleeve to an iron rod, <i>Q</i>, which was provided with the necessary screw
    adjustments, <i>R</i> and <i>S</i>, for centring and lowering it as the drop
    grew in size. Great care was exercised to free the powder from any
    trace of potassium, which, if present, imparted a brownish tinge to
    the stone. The pressure of the oxygen, low initially both to prevent
    the pedestal from melting, and to keep the area of the drop in contact
    with the pedestal as small as possible, because otherwise flaws tended
    to start on cooling, was gradually increased until the flame reached
    the critical temperature which kept the top of the drop melted, but
    not boiling. The supply of powder was at the same time carefully
    proportioned to the pressure. The pedestal, <i>P</i>, was from time to time
    lowered, and the drop grew in the shape of a pear (Fig. 54), the apex
    of which was downwards and adhered to the pedestal by a narrow stalk.
    As soon as the drop reached the maximum size possible with the size of
    the flame, the gases were sharply and simultaneously cut off. After ten
    minutes or so the drop was lowered from the chamber, <i>M</i>, by the screw,
    <i>S</i>, and when quite cold was removed from the pedestal.</p>

  <p>Very few changes have been made in the method when adapted to
    commercial use. Coal-gas has,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> however, entirely replaced the
    costly hydrogen, and the hammer is operated by a cam instead of an
    electromagnet, while, as may be seen from the view of a gem-stone
    factory (<a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>), a number of blowpipes are placed in line so that
    their cams are worked by the same shaft, <i>a</i>. The fire-clay screen,
    <i>b</i>, surrounding the flame is for convenience of removal divided into
    halves longitudinally, and a small hole is left in front for viewing
    the stone during growth, a red glass screen, <i>c</i>, being provided in
    front to protect the eyes from the intense glare. Half the fire-clay
    screen of the blowpipe in the centre of the Plate has been removed to
    show the arrangement of the interior. The centring and the raising
    and lowering apparatus, <i>d</i>, have been modified. The process is so
    simple that one man can attend to a dozen or so of these machines, and
    it takes only one hour to grow a drop large enough to be cut into a
    ten-carat stone.</p>

  <p>The drops, unless the finished stone is required to have a similar
    pear shape, are divided longitudinally through the central core into
    halves, which in both shape and orientation are admirably suited to the
    purposes of cutting; as a general rule, the drop splits during cooling
    into the desired direction of its own accord.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Each drop is a single crystalline individual, and not, as might have
    been anticipated, an alumina glass or an irregular aggregation of
    crystalline fragments, and, if the drop has cooled properly, the
    crystallographic axis is parallel to the core of the pear. The cut
    stone will therefore have not only the density and hardness, but also
    all the optical characters—refractivity, double refraction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span> dichroism,
    etc.—pertaining to the natural species, and will obey precisely the
    same tests with the refractometer and the dichroscope. Were it not for
    certain imperfections it would be impossible to distinguish between the
    stones formed in Nature’s vast workshop and those produced within the
    confines of a laboratory. The artificial stones, however, are rarely,
    if ever, free from minute air-bubbles (Fig. 55), which can easily be
    seen with an ordinary lens. Their spherical shape differentiates them
    from the plane-sided cavities not infrequently visible in a natural
    stone (Fig. 56). Moreover, the colouring matter varies slightly, but
    imperceptibly, in successive shells, and consequently in the finished
    stone a careful eye can discern the curved striations (Fig. 55)
    corresponding in shape to the original shell. In a natural stone, on
    the other hand, although zones of different colours or varying shades
    are not uncommon, the resulting striations are straight (Fig. 56),
    corresponding to the plane faces of the original crystal form. By
    sacrificing material it might be possible to cut a small stone free
    from bubbles, but the curved striations would always be present to
    betray its origin.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The success that attended the manufacture of ruby encouraged efforts to
    impart other tints to crystallized alumina. By reducing the percentage
    amount of chromic oxide, pink stones were turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> out, in colour not
    unlike those Brazilian topazes, the original hue of which has been
    altered by the application of heat. These artificial stones have
    therefore been called ‘scientific topaz’; of course, quite wrongly,
    since topaz, which is properly a fluo-silicate of aluminium, is quite a
    different substance.</p>

  <p>Early attempts made to obtain the exquisite blue tint of the true
    sapphire were frustrated by an unexpected difficulty. The colouring
    matter, cobalt oxide, was not diffused evenly through the drop, but
    was huddled together in splotches, and it was found necessary to add a
    considerable amount of magnesia as a flux before a uniform distribution
    of colour could be secured. It was then discovered that, despite the
    colour, the stones had the physical characters, not of sapphire, but
    of the species closely allied to it, namely, spinel, aluminate of
    magnesium. By an unsurpassable effort of nomenclature these blue stones
    were given the extraordinary name of ‘Hope sapphire,’ from fanciful
    analogy with the famous blue diamond which was once the pride of the
    Hope collection. A blue spinel is occasionally found in nature, but the
    actual tint is somewhat different. These manufactured stones have the
    disadvantage of turning purple in artificial light. By substituting
    lime for magnesia as a flux, Paris, a pupil of Verneuil’s, produced
    blue stones which were not affected to the same extent. The difficulty
    was at length overcome at the close of 1909, when Verneuil, by
    employing as tinctorial agents 0·5 per cent. of titanium oxide and 1·5
    per cent. of magnetic iron oxide, succeeded in producing blue corundum;
    it, however, had not quite the tint of sapphire. Stones subsequently
    manufactured, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> better in colour, contained about 0·12 per
    cent. of titanium oxide, but no iron at all.</p>

  <p>By the addition to the alumina of a little nickel oxide and vanadium
    oxide respectively, yellow and yellowish green corundums have been
    obtained. The latter have in artificial light a distinctly reddish
    hue, and have therefore been termed ‘scientific alexandrite’; of
    course, quite incorrectly, since the true alexandrite is a variety of
    chrysoberyl, aluminate of beryllium, a very different substance.</p>

  <p>If no colouring matter at all be added and the alum be free from
    potash, colourless stones or white sapphires are formed, which pass
    under the name ‘scientific brilliant.’ It is scarcely necessary to
    remark that they are quite distinct from the true brilliant, diamond.</p>

  <p>The high prices commanded by emeralds, and the comparative success that
    attended the reconstruction of ruby from fragments of natural stones,
    suggested that equal success might follow from a similar process with
    powdered beryl, chromic oxide being used as the colouring agent. The
    resulting stones are, indeed, a fair imitation, being even provided
    with flaws, but they are a beryl glass with lower specific gravity and
    refractivity than the true beryl, and are wrongly termed ‘scientific
    emerald.’ Moreover, recently most of the stones so named on the market
    are merely green paste.</p>

  <p>It is unfortunate that the real success which has been achieved in the
    manufacture of ruby and sapphire should be obscured by the ill-founded
    claims tacitly asserted in other cases.</p>

  <p>At the time the manufactured ruby was a novelty it fetched as much as
    £6 a carat, but as soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> it was discovered that it could easily
    be differentiated from the natural stone, a collapse took place, and
    the price fell abruptly to 30s., and eventually to 5s. and even 1s.
    a carat. The sapphires run slightly higher, from 2s. to 7s. a carat.
    The prices of the natural stones, which at first had fallen, have now
    risen to almost their former level. The extreme disparity at present
    obtaining between the prices of the artificial and the natural ruby
    renders the fraudulent substitution of the one for the other a great
    temptation, and it behoves purchasers to beware where and from whom
    they buy, and to be suspicious of apparently remarkable bargains,
    especially at places like Colombo and Singapore where tourists abound.
    It is no secret that some thousands of carats of manufactured rubies
    are shipped annually to the East. <i xml:lang="la">Caveat emptor.</i></p>

    <div class="headingc">IMITATION STONES</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE beryl glass mentioned in the previous chapter marks the transition
    stage between manufactured stones which in all essential characters
    are identical with those found in nature, and artificial stones which
    resemble the corresponding natural stone in outward appearance only. In
    a sense both sorts may be styled artificial, but it would be misleading
    to confound them under the same appellation.</p>

  <p>Common paste,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which is met with in drapery goods and cheap ornaments
    in general—hat-pins, buckles, and so forth—is composed of ordinary
    crown-glass or flint-glass, the refractive indices being about 1·53 and
    1·63 respectively. The finest quality, which is used for imitations of
    brilliants, is called ‘strass.’ It is a dense lead flint-glass of high
    refraction and strong colour-dispersion, consisting of 38·2 per cent.
    of silica, 53·3 red lead (oxide of lead), and 7·8 potassium carbonate,
    with small quantities of soda, alumina, and other substances. How
    admirable these imitations may be, a study of the windows of a shop
    devoted <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>to such things will show. Unfortunately the addition of
    lead, which is necessary for imparting the requisite refraction and
    ‘fire’ to the strass, renders the stones exceedingly soft. All glass
    yields to the file, but strass stones are scratched even by ordinary
    window-glass. If worn in such a way that they are rubbed, they
    speedily lose the brilliance of their polish, and, moreover, they are
    susceptible to attack by the sulphurous fumes present in the smoky air
    of towns, and turn after a time a dirty brown in hue. When coloured
    stones are to be imitated, small quantities of a suitable metallic
    oxide are fused with the glass; cobalt gives rise to a royal-blue tint,
    chromium a ruby red, and manganese a violet. Common paste is not highly
    refractive enough to give satisfactory results when cut as a brilliant,
    and the bases are therefore often coated with quicksilver, or, in the
    case of old jewellery, covered with foil in the setting, in order to
    secure more complete reflection from the interior. The fashioning of
    these imitation stones is easy and cheap. Being moulded, they do not
    require cutting, and the polishing of the facets thus formed is soon
    done on account of the softness of the stones.</p>

  <p>A test with a file readily differentiates paste stones from the natural
    stones they pretend to be. Being necessarily singly refractive, they
    are, of course, lacking in dichroism, and their refractivity seldom
    accords even approximately with that of the corresponding natural stone.</p>

  <p>In order to meet the test for hardness the doublet was devised. Such
    a stone is composed of two parts—the crown consisting of colourless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
    quartz or other inexpensive real and hard stone, and the base being
    made up of coloured glass. When the imitation, say of a sapphire, is
    intended to be more exact, the crown is made of a real sapphire, but
    one deficient in colour, the requisite tint being obtained from the
    paste forming the under part of the doublet. In case the base should
    also be tested for hardness the triplet has been devised. In this the
    base is made of a real stone also, and the coloured paste is confined
    to the girdle section, where it is hidden by the setting. Sapphires and
    emeralds of indifferent colour are sometimes slit across the girdle;
    the interior surfaces are polished, and colouring matter is introduced
    with the cement, generally Canada balsam, which is used to re-unite the
    two portions of the stone together. All such imitations may be detected
    by placing the stone in oil, when the surfaces separating the portions
    of the composite stone will be visible, or the binding cement may be
    dissolved by immersing the stone, if unmounted, in boiling water, or in
    alcohol or chloroform, when the stone will fall to pieces.</p>

  <p>The glass imitations of pearls, which have become very common in recent
    years, may, apart from their inferior iridescence, be detected by
    their greater hardness, or by the apparent doubling of, say, a spot of
    ink placed on the surface, owing to reflection from the inner surface
    of the glass shell. They are made of small hollow spheres formed by
    blowing. Next to the glass comes a lining of parchment size, and next
    the under lining, which is the most important part of the imitation,
    consisting of a preparation of fish scales called <i xml:lang="fr">Essence d’Orient</i>,
    When the lining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> is dry, the globe is filled with hot wax to impart the
    necessary solidity. In cheap imitations the glass balls are not lined
    at all, but merely heated with hydrochloric acid to give an iridescence
    to the surface; sometimes they are coated with wax, which can be
    scraped off with a knife.</p>

      PRECIOUS STONES</div>
    <h2 class="nopage"><span class="gespertt">CHAPTER XVI</span></h2>
    <div class="headingc">DIAMOND</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">DIAMOND has held pride of place as chief of precious stones ever
    since the discovery of the form of cutting known as the ‘brilliant’
    revealed to full perfection its amazing qualities; and justly so,
    since it combines in itself extreme hardness, high refraction, large
    colour-dispersion, and brilliant lustre. A rough diamond, especially
    from river gravels, has often a peculiar greasy appearance, and is
    no more attractive to the eye than a piece of washing-soda. It is
    therefore easy to understand why the Persians in the thirteenth century
    placed the pearl, ruby, emerald, and even peridot before it, and
    writers in the Middle Ages frequently esteemed it below emerald and
    ruby. The Indian lapidaries, who were the first to realize that diamond
    could be ground with its own powder, discovered what a wonderful
    difference the removal of the skin makes in the appearance of a stone.
    They, however, made no attempt to shape a stone, but merely polished
    the natural facets, and only added numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> small facets when they
    wished to conceal flaws or other imperfections; indeed, the famous
    traveller, Tavernier, from whom most of our knowledge of early mining
    in India is obtained, invariably found that a stone covered with many
    facets was badly flawed. The full radiant beauty of a diamond comes to
    light only when it is cut in brilliant form.</p>

  <p>Of all precious stones diamond has the simplest composition; it is
    merely crystallized carbon, another form of which is the humble and
    useful graphite, commonly known as ‘black-lead.’ Surely nature has
    surpassed all her marvellous efforts in producing from the same element
    substances with such divergent characters as the hard, brilliant, and
    transparent diamond and the soft, dull, and opaque graphite. It is,
    however, impossible to draw any sharp dividing line between the two;
    soft diamond passes insensibly into hard graphite, and vice versa.
    Boart, or bort, as it is sometimes written, is composed of minute
    crystals of diamond arranged haphazardly; it possesses no cleavage,
    its hardness is greater than that of the crystals, and its colour is
    greyish to blackish. Carbon, carbonado, or black diamond, which is
    composed of still more minute crystals, is black and opaque, and is
    perceptibly harder than the crystals. It passes into graphite, which
    varies in hardness, and may have any density between 2·O and 3·O.
    Jewellers apply the term boart to crystals or fragments which are of no
    service as gems; such pieces are crushed to powder and used for cutting
    and polishing purposes.</p>

  <p>Diamonds, when absolutely limpid and free from flaws, are said to be
    of the ‘first water,’ and are most prized when devoid of any tinge of
    colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> except perhaps bluish (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 1). Stones with a slight
    tinge of yellow are termed ‘off-coloured,’ and are far less valuable.
    Those of a canary-yellow colour (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 3), however, belong to a
    different category, and have a decided attractiveness. Greenish stones
    also are common, though it is rare to come across one with a really
    good shade of that colour. Brown stones, especially in South Africa,
    are not uncommon. Pink stones are less common, and ruby-red and blue
    stones are rare. Those of the last-named colour have usually what is
    known as a ‘steely’ shade, <i>i.e.</i> they are tinged with green; stones of
    a sapphire blue are very seldom met with, and such command high prices.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 57—59.</span>—Diamond Crystals.</div>
  </div>

    <p>Diamond crystallizes (Figs. 57—59 and <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 2) in octahedra
    with brilliant, smooth faces, and occasionally in cubes with rough
    pitted faces; sometimes three or six faces take the place of each
    octahedron face, and the stone is almost spherical in shape. The
    surfaces of the crystals are often marked with equilateral triangles,
    which are supposed to represent the effects of incipient combustion.
    Twinned crystals, in which the two individuals may be connected by a
    single plane or may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> interpenetrating, a star shape often resulting
    in the latter case, are common; sometimes, if of the octahedron type,
    they are beautifully symmetrical. The rounded crystals are frequently
    covered with a peculiar gum-like skin which is somewhat less hard than
    the crystal itself. A large South African stone, weighing 27 grams (130
    carats) and octahedral in shape, which was the gift of John Ruskin,
    and named by him the ‘Colenso’ after the first bishop of Natal, is
    exhibited in the British Museum (Natural History); its appearance is,
    however, marred by its distinctly ‘off-coloured’ tint.</p>

  <p>The refraction of diamond is single, but local double refraction is
    common, indicating a state of strain which can often be traced to an
    included drop of liquid carbonic acid; so great is the strain that many
    a fine stone has burst to fragments on being removed from the ground
    in which it has lain. The refractive index for the yellow light of a
    sodium flame is 2·4175, and the slight variation from this mean value
    that has been observed, amounting only to 0·0001, testifies to the
    purity of the composition. The colour-dispersion is large, being as
    much as 0·044, in which respect it surpasses all colourless stones,
    but is exceeded by sphene and the green garnet from the Urals (cf. <a href="#Page_217">p.
    217</a>). The lustre of diamond, when polished, is so characteristic as to
    be termed adamantine, and is due to the combination of high refraction
    and extreme hardness. Diamond is translucent to the X (Röntgen) rays;
    it phosphoresces under the action of radium, and of a high-tension
    electric current when placed in a vacuum tube, and sometimes even when
    exposed to strong sunlight. Some diamonds fluoresce in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> sunlight,
    turning milky, and a few even emit light when rubbed. Crookes found
    that a diamond buried in radium bromide for a year had acquired a
    lovely blue tint, which was not affected even by heating to redness.
    The specific gravity is likewise constant, being 3·521, with a possible
    variation from that mean value of 0·005; but a greater range, as might
    be expected, is found in the impure boart.</p>

  <p>Diamond is by far the hardest substance in nature, being marked 10 in
    Mohs’s scale of hardness, but it varies in itself; stones from Borneo
    and New South Wales are so perceptibly harder than those usually in
    the lapidaries’ hands, that they can be cut only with their own and
    not ordinary diamond powder, and some difficulty was experienced in
    cutting them when they first came into the market. It is interesting
    to note that the metal tantalum, the isolation of which in commercial
    amount constituted one of the triumphs of chemistry of recent years,
    has about the same hardness as diamond. Despite its extreme hardness
    diamond readily cleaves under a heavy blow in planes parallel to the
    faces of the regular octahedron, a property utilized for shaping the
    stone previous to cutting it. The fallacious, but not unnatural,
    idea was prevalent up to quite modern times that a diamond would,
    even if placed on an anvil, resist a blow from a hammer: who knows
    how many fine stones have succumbed to this illusory test? The fact
    that diamond could be split was known to Indian lapidaries at the
    time of Tavernier’s visit, and it would appear from De Boodt that in
    the sixteenth century the cleavability of diamond was not unknown in
    Europe, but it was not credited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> at the time and was soon forgotten.
    Early last century Wollaston, a famous chemist and mineralogist,
    rediscovered the property, and, so it is said, used his knowledge to
    some profit by purchasing large stones, which because of their awkward
    shape or the presence of flaws in the interior were rejected by the
    lapidaries, and selling them back again after cleaving them to suitable
    forms.</p>

    <p>It has already been remarked (<a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>) that the interval in hardness
    between diamond and corundum, which comes next to it in Mohs’s scale,
    is enormously greater than that between corundum and the softest of
    minerals. Diamond can therefore be cut only with the aid of its own
    powder, and the cutting of diamond is therefore differentiated from
    that of other stones, the precious-stone trade being to a large extent
    divided into two distinct groups, namely, dealers in diamonds, and
    dealers in all other gem-stones.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is derived from the popular form, <i>adiamentem</i>,
    of the Latin <i xml:lang="la">adamantem</i>, itself the alliterative form of the Greek
    <span xml:lang="el">ἀδάμας</span>, meaning the unconquerable, in allusion not merely to
    the great hardness but also to the mistaken idea already mentioned.
    Boart probably comes from the Old-French <i xml:lang="fr">bord</i> or <i xml:lang="fr">bort</i>, bastard.</p>

  <p>At the present day diamonds are usually cut as brilliants, though
    the contour of the girdle may be circular, oval, or drop-shaped to
    suit the particular purpose for which the stone is required, or to
    keep the weight as great as possible. Small stones for bordering a
    large coloured stone may also be cut as roses or points. A perfect
    brilliant has 58 facets, but small stones may have not more than 44,
    and exceptionally large stones may with advantage have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> many more; for
    instance, on the largest stone cut from the Cullinan diamond there are
    no fewer than 74 facets.</p>

  <p>The description of the properties of diamond would not be complete
    without a reference to the other valuable, if utilitarian, purposes
    to which it is put. Without its aid much of modern engineering work
    and mining operations would be impossible except at the cost of almost
    prohibitive expenditure of time and money.</p>

  <p>Boring through solid rock has been greatly facilitated by the use of
    the diamond drill. For this purpose carbonado or black diamond is more
    serviceable than single crystals, and the price of the former has
    consequently advanced from a nominal figure up to £3 to £12 a carat.
    The actual working part of the drill consists of a cast-steel ring.
    The crown of it has a number of small depressions at regular intervals
    into which the carbonados are embedded. On revolution of the drill an
    annular ring is cut, leaving a solid core which can be drawn to the
    surface. For cooling the drill and for washing away the detritus water
    is pumped through to the working face. The duration of the carbonados
    depends on the nature of the rock and the skill of the operator. The
    most troublesome rock is a sandstone or one with sharp differences in
    hardness, because the carbonados are liable to be torn out of their
    setting. An experienced operator can tell by the feel of the drill the
    nature of the rock at the working face, and by varying the pressure can
    mitigate the risk of damage to the drill.</p>

  <p>The tenacity of diamond renders it most suitable for wire-drawing. The
    tungsten filaments used in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> many of the latest forms of incandescent
    electric lamps are prepared in this manner.</p>

  <p>Diamond powder is used for cutting and turning the hardened steel
    employed in modern armaments and for other more peaceful purposes.</p>

  <p>Although nearly all the gem-stones scratch glass, diamond alone can be
    satisfactorily employed to cut it along a definite edge. Any flake at
    random will not be suitable, because it will tear the glass and form a
    jagged edge. The best results are given by the junction of two edges
    which do not meet in too obtuse an angle; two edges of the rhombic
    dodecahedron meet the requirements admirably. The stones used by the
    glaziers are minute in size, being not much larger than a pin’s head,
    and thirty of them on an average go to the carat. They are set in
    copper or brass. Some little skill is needed to obtain the best results.</p>

  <p>The value of a diamond has always been determined largely by the size
    of the stone, the old rule being that the rate per carat should be
    multiplied by the square of the weight in carats; thus, if the rate be
    £10, the cost of a two-carat stone is four times this sum, or £40, of
    a three-carat stone £90, and so on. For a century, from 1750 to 1850,
    the rate remained almost constant at £4 for rough, £6 for rose-cut,
    and £8 for brilliant-cut diamonds. Since the latter date, owing to
    the increase in the supply of gold, the growth of the spending power
    of the world, and the gradual falling off in the productiveness of
    the Brazilian fields, the rate steadily increased about 10 per cent.
    each year, until in 1865 the rate for brilliants was £18. The rise was
    checked by the discovery of the South African mines; moreover.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> since
    comparatively large stones are plentiful in these mines, the rule
    of the increase in the price of a stone by the square of its weight
    no longer holds. The rate for the most perfect stones still remains
    high, because such are not so common in the South African mines. The
    classification<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> adopted by the syndicate of London diamond merchants
    who place upon the market the output of the De Beers group of mines is
    as follows:—(<i>a</i>) Blue-white, (<i>b</i>) white, (<i>c</i>) silvery Cape, (<i>d</i>)
    fine Cape, (<i>e</i>) Cape, (<i>f</i>) fine bywater, (<i>g</i>) bywater, (<i>h</i>) fine

    <div class="headingc">OCCURRENCE OF DIAMOND</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE whole of the diamonds known in ancient times were obtained from
    the so-called Golconda mines in India. Golconda itself, now a deserted
    fortress near Hyderabad, was merely the mart where the diamonds were
    bought and sold. The diamond-bearing district actually spread over a
    wide area on the eastern side of the Deccan, extending from the Pinner
    River in the Madras Presidency northwards to the Rivers Son and Khan,
    tributaries of the Ganges, in Bundelkhand. The richest mines, where
    the large historical stones were found, are in the south, mostly
    near the Kistna River. The diamonds were discovered in sandstone,
    or conglomerate, or the sands and gravels of river-beds. The mines
    were visited in the middle of the seventeenth century by the French
    traveller and jeweller, Tavernier, when travelling on a commission
    for Louis XIV, and he afterwards published a careful description of
    them and of the method of working them. The mines seem to have been
    exhausted in the seventeenth century; at any rate, the prospecting,
    which has been spasmodically carried on during the last two centuries,
    has proved almost abortive. With the exception of the Koh-i-nor, all
    the large Indian diamonds were probably discovered not long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> before
    Tavernier’s visit. The diamonds known to Pliny, and in his time, were
    quite small, and it is doubtful if any stones of considerable size came
    to light before <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1000.</p>

  <p>India enjoyed the monopoly of supplying the world’s demand for diamonds
    up to the discovery, in 1725, of the precious stone in Brazil. Small
    stones were detected by the miners in the gold washings at Tejuco,
    about eighty miles (129 km.) from Rio de Janeiro, in the Serro do Frio
    district of the State of Minas Geraes. The discovery naturally caused
    great excitement. So many diamonds were found that in 1727 something
    like a slump took place in their value. In order to keep up prices, the
    Dutch merchants, who mainly controlled the Indian output, asserted that
    the diamonds had not been found in Brazil at all, but were inferior
    Indian stones shipped to Brazil from Goa. The tables were neatly turned
    when diamonds were actually shipped from Brazil to Goa, and exported
    thence to Europe as Indian stones. This course and the continuous
    development of the diamond district in Brazil rendered it impossible
    to hoodwink the world indefinitely. The drop in prices was, however,
    stayed by the action of the Portuguese government, who exacted such
    heavy duties and imposed such onerous conditions that finally no one
    would undertake to work the mines. Accordingly, in 1772 diamond-mining
    was declared a royal monopoly in Brazil, and such it remained until
    the severance of Brazil from Portugal in 1834, when private mining was
    permitted by the new government subject to the payment of reasonable
    royalties. The industry was enormously stimulated by the discovery, in
    1844, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> the remarkably rich fields in the State of Bahia, especially
    at Serra da Cincorá, where carbonado, or black diamond, first came to
    light, but after a few years, owing to the difficulties of supplying
    labour, the unhealthiness of the climate, and the high cost of living,
    the yield fell off and gradually declined, until the importance of the
    fields was finally eclipsed by the rise of the South African mines.
    The Brazilian mines have proved very productive, but chiefly in small
    diamonds, stones above a carat in weight being few in comparison. The
    largest stone, to which the name, the Star of the South, was applied,
    weighed in the rough 254½ carats; it was discovered at the Bagagem
    mines in 1853. The quality of the diamonds is good, many of them having
    the highly-prized bluish-white colour. The principal diamond-bearing
    districts of Brazil centre at Diamantina, as Tejuco was re-named
    after the discovery of diamonds, Grão Magor, and Bagagem in the State
    of Minas Geraes, at Diamantina in the State of Bahia, and at Goyãz
    and Matto Grosso in the States of the same names. The diamonds occur
    chiefly in <i xml:lang="es">cascalho</i>, a gravel, containing large masses of quartz
    and small particles of gold, which is supposed to be derived from a
    quartzose variety of micaceous slate known as itacolumite. The mines
    are now to some extent being worked by systematic dredging of the
    river-beds.</p>

  <p>Early in 1867 the children of a Boer farmer, Daniel Jacobs, who dwelt
    near Hopetown on the banks of the Orange River, picked up in the course
    of play near the river a white pebble, which was destined not only to
    mark the commencement of a new epoch in the record of diamond mines,
    but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> change the whole course of the history of South Africa. This
    pebble attracted the attention of a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, who
    suspected that it might be of some value, and offered to buy it. Mrs.
    Jacobs, however, gave it him, laughingly scouting the idea of accepting
    money for a mere pebble. Van Niekerk showed it to a travelling trader,
    by name John O’Reilly, who undertook to obtain what he could for it on
    condition that they shared the proceeds. Every one he met laughed to
    scorn the idea that the stone had any value, and it was once thrown
    away and only recovered after some search in a yard, but at length he
    showed it to Lorenzo Boyes, the Acting Civil Commissioner at Colesberg,
    who, from its extreme hardness, thought it might be diamond and sent
    it to the mineralogist, W. Guybon Atherston, of Grahamstown, for
    determination. So uncertain was Boyes of its value that he did not even
    seal up the envelope containing it, much less register the package.
    Atherston found immediately that the long-scorned pebble was really
    a fine diamond, weighing 21<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> carats, and with O’Reilly’s consent
    he submitted it to Sir Philip Wodehouse, Governor at the Cape. The
    latter purchased it at once for £500, and dispatched it to be shown
    at the Paris Exhibition of that year. It did not, however, attract
    much attention; chimerical tales of diamond finds in remote parts of
    the world are not unknown. Indeed, for some time only a few small
    stones were picked up beside the Orange River, and no one believed in
    the existence of any extensive diamond deposit. However, all doubt as
    to the advisibility of prospecting the district was settled by the
    discovery of the superb diamond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> afterwards known as the ‘Star of
    South Africa,’ which was picked up in March 1869 by a shepherd boy
    on the Zendfontein farm near the Orange River. Van Niekerk, on the
    alert for news of further discoveries, at once hurried to the spot and
    purchased the stone from the boy for five hundred sheep, ten oxen, and
    a horse, which seemed to the boy untold wealth, but was not a tithe of
    the £11,200 which Lilienfeld Bros., of Hopetown, gave Van Niekerk.</p>

  <p>This remarkable discovery attracted immediate attention to the
    potentialities of a country which produced diamonds of such a size, and
    prospectors began to swarm into the district, gradually spreading up
    the Vaal River. For some little time not much success was experienced,
    but at length, early in 1870, a rich find was made at Klipdrift,
    now known as Barkly West, which was on the banks of the Vaal River
    immediately opposite the Mission camp at Pniel. The number of miners
    steadily increased until the population on the two sides of the river
    included altogether some four or five thousand people, and there was
    every appearance of stability in the existing order of things. But a
    vast change came over the scene upon the discovery of still richer
    mines lying to the south-east and some distance from the river. The
    ground was actually situated on the route traversed by parties hurrying
    to the Vaal River, but no one dreamed of the wealth that lay under
    their feet. The first discovery was made in August 1870 at the farm
    Jagersfontein, near Fauresmith in Orange River Colony, by De Klerk,
    the intelligent overseer, who noticed in the dry bed of a stream a
    number of garnets, and, knowing that they often accompanied diamond,
    had the curiosity <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>to investigate the point. He was immediately
    rewarded by finding a fine diamond weighing 50 carats. In the following
    month diamonds were discovered about twenty miles from Klipdrift
    at Dutoitspan on the Dorstfontein farm, and a little later also on
    the contiguous farm of Bultfontein; a diamond was actually found in
    the mortar used in the homestead of the latter farm. Early in May
    1871 diamonds were found about two miles away on De Beers’ farm,
    Vooruitzigt, and two months later, in July, a far richer find was made
    on the same farm at a spot which was first named Colesberg Kopje, the
    initial band of prospectors having come from the town of that name
    near the Orange River, but was subsequently known as Kimberley after
    the Secretary of State for the Colonies at that time. Soon a large
    and prosperous town sprang up close to the mines; it rapidly grew
    in size and importance, and to this day remains the centre of the
    diamond-mining industry. Subsequent prospecting proved almost blank
    until the discovery of the Premier or Wesselton mine on Wesselton
    farm, about four miles from Kimberley, in September 1890; it received
    the former name after Rhodes, who was Premier of Cape Colony at that
    date. No further discovery of any importance was made until, in 1902,
    diamonds were found about twenty miles north-west-north of Pretoria in
    the Transvaal, at the new Premier mine, now famed as the producer of
    the gigantic Cullinan diamond.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Kimberley mines were at first known as the ‘dry diggings’ on
    account of their arid surroundings in contradistinction to the ‘river
    diggings’ by the Vaal. The dearth of water was at first one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> the
    great difficulties in the way of working the former mines, although
    subsequently the accumulation of underground water at lower levels
    proved a great obstacle to the working of the mines. The ‘river
    diggings’ were of a type similar to that met with in India and Brazil,
    the diamonds occurring in a gravelly deposit of limited thickness
    beneath which was barren rock, but the Kimberley mines presented a
    phenomenon hitherto without precedent in the whole history of diamond
    mining. The diamonds were found in a loose surface deposit, which was
    easily worked, and for some time the prospectors thought that the
    underlying limestone corresponded to the bedrock of the river gravel,
    until at length one more curious than his fellows investigated the
    yellowish ground underneath, and found to his surprise that it was even
    richer than the surface layer. Immediately a rush was made back to the
    deserted claims, and the mines were busier than ever. This ‘yellow
    ground,’ as it is popularly called, was much decomposed and easy,
    therefore, to work and sift. About fifty to sixty feet (15–18 m.) below
    the surface, however, it passed into a far harder rock, which from its
    colour is known as the ‘blue ground’; this also, to the unexpected
    pleasure of the miners, turned out to contain diamonds. Difficulties
    arose as each claim, 30 by 30 Dutch feet (about 31 English feet or
    9·45 metres square) in area, was worked downwards. In the Kimberley
    mine (<a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a>) access to the various claims was secured by retaining
    parallel strips, 15 feet wide, each claim being, therefore, reduced
    in width to 22½ feet, to form roadways running from side to side of
    the mine in one direction. These,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> however, soon gave way, not only
    because of the falling of the earth composing them, but because they
    were undermined and undercut by the owners of the adjacent claims.
    By the end of 1872 the last roadway had disappeared, and the mine
    presented the appearance of a vast pit. In order to obtain access to
    the claims without intruding on those lying between, and to provide for
    the hauling of the loads of earth to the surface, an ingenious system
    of wire cables in three tiers (<a href="#Plate_XVII">Plate XVII</a>) was erected, the lowest
    tier being connected to the outermost claims, the second to claims
    farther from the edge, and the highest to claims in the centre of the
    pit. The mine at that date presented a most remarkable spectacle,
    resembling an enormous radiating cobweb, which had a weird charm by
    night as the moonlight softly illuminated it, and by day, owing to
    the perpetual ring of the flanged wheels of the trucks on the running
    wires, twanged like some gigantic æolian harp. This system fulfilled
    its purpose admirably until, with increasing depth of the workings,
    other serious difficulties arose. Deprived of the support of the hard
    blue ground, the walls of the mine tended to collapse, and additional
    trouble was caused by the underground water that percolated into the
    mine. By the end of 1883 the floor of the Kimberley mine was almost
    entirely covered by falls of ‘reef’ (<a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>), as the surrounding
    rocks are termed, the depth then being about 400 feet (122 m.). In the
    De Beers mine, in spite of the precaution taken to prevent falls of
    reef by cutting the walls of the mine back in terraces, falls occurred
    continuously in 1884, and by 1887, at a depth of 350 feet (107 m.),
    all attempts at open working <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> had to be abandoned. In the Dutoitspan
    mine buttresses of blue ground were left, which held back the reef for
    some years, but ultimately the mine became unsafe, and in March 1886 a
    disastrous fall took place, in which eighteen miners—eight white men
    and ten Kafirs—lost their lives. The Bultfontein mine was worked to the
    great depth of 500 feet (152 m.), but falls occurred in 1889 and put
    an end to open working. In all cases, therefore, the ultimate end was
    the same: the floor of the mine became covered with a mass of worthless
    reef, which rendered mining from above ground dangerous, and, indeed,
    impossible except at prohibitive cost. It was then clearly necessary
    to effect access to the diamond-bearing ground by means of shafts sunk
    at a sufficient distance from the mine to remove any fear of falls of
    reef. For such schemes co-operative working was absolutely essential.
    <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a> illustrates the desolate character of the Kimberley mine
    above ground and the vastness of the yawning pit, which is over 1000
    feet (300 m.) in depth.</p>

  <p>A certain amount of linking up of claims had already taken place, but,
    although many men must have seen that the complete amalgamation of the
    interests in each mine was imperative, two men alone had the capacity
    to bring their ideas to fruition. C. J. Rhodes was the principal agent
    in the formation in April 1880 of the De Beers Mining Company, which
    rapidly absorbed the remaining claims in the mine, and was re-formed
    in 1887 as the De Beers Consolidated Mining Company. Meantime, Barnett
    Isaacs, better known by the cognomen Barnato, which had been adopted by
    his</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>brother Henry when engaged in earning his livelihood in the diamond
    fields as an entertainer, had secured the major interests in the
    Kimberley mine. Rhodes saw that, for effective working of the two
    mines by any system of underground working, they must be under one
    management, but to all suggestions of amalgamation Barnato remained
    deaf, and at last Rhodes determined to secure control of the Kimberley
    mine at all costs. The story of the titanic struggle between these
    two men forms one of the epics of finance. Eventually, when shares
    in the Kimberley mine had been boomed to an extraordinary height,
    and the price of diamonds had fallen as low as 18s. a carat, Barnato
    gave way, and in July 1889 the Kimberley mine was absorbed by the De
    Beers Company on payment of the enormous sum of £5,338,650. Shortly
    afterwards they undertook the working of the Dutoitspan and the
    Bultfontein mines, and in January 1896 they acquired the Premier or
    Wesselton mine. The interests in the Jagersfontein mine were in 1888
    united in the New Jagersfontein Mining and Exploration Company, and
    the mine is now worked also by the De Beers Company. Thus, until the
    development of the new Premier mine in the Transvaal, the De Beers
    Company practically controlled the diamond market. The development
    of this last mine was begun so recently, and its size is so vast—the
    longest diameter being half a mile—that open-cut working is likely to
    continue for some years.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Though varying slightly in details, the methods of working the mines
    are identical in principle. From the steeply inclined shaft horizontal
    galleries are run diagonally right across the mine, the vertical
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> interval between successive galleries being 40 feet. From each
    gallery side galleries are run at right angles to it and parallel to
    the working face. The blue ground is worked systematically backwards
    from the working face. The mass is stoped, <i>i.e.</i> drilled and broken
    from the bottom upwards, until only a thin roof is left. As soon as the
    section is worked out and the material removed, the roof is allowed
    to fall in, and work is begun on the next section of the same level;
    at the same time the first section on the level next below is opened
    out. Thus work is simultaneously carried on in several levels, and a
    vertical plane would intersect the working faces in a straight line
    obliquely inclined to the vertical direction (Fig. 60). When freshly
    mined, the blue ground is hard and compact, but it soon disintegrates
    under atmospheric influence. Indeed, the yellow ground itself was
    merely decomposed blue ground. No immediate attempt is made, therefore,
    to retrieve the precious stones. The blue ground is spread on to
    the ‘floors’ (<a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a>), <i>i.e.</i> spaces of open veldt which have
    been cleared of bushes and inequalities, to the depth of a couple of
    feet, and remains there for periods ranging from six months to two
    years, depending on the quality of the blue ground and the amount of
    rainfall. To hasten the disintegration the blue ground is frequently
    ploughed over and occasionally watered, a remarkable introduction of
    agricultural methods into mining operations. No elaborate patrolling
    or guarding is required, because the diamonds are so sparsely, though
    regularly, scattered through the mass that even of the actual workers
    in the mines but few have ever seen a stone in the blue ground. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
    sufficiently broken up, it is carted to the washing and concentrating
    machines, by means of which the diamonds and the heavier constituents
    are separated from the lighter material.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span>—Vertical Section of Diamond Pipe,
    showing Tunnels and Stopes.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Formerly the diamonds were picked out from the concentrates by means
    of the keen eyes of skilled natives; but the process has been vastly
    simplified and the risk of theft entirely eliminated by the remarkable
    discovery made in 1897 by F. Kirsten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> of the De Beers Company, that
    of all the heavy constituents of the blue ground diamond alone, with
    the exception of an occasional corundum and zircon, which are easily
    sorted out afterwards, adheres to grease more readily than to water.
    In this ingenious machine, the ‘jigger’ or ‘greaser’ (<a href="#Plate_XXIII">Plate XXIII</a>) as
    it is commonly termed, the concentrates are washed over a series of
    galvanized-iron trays, which are covered with a thick coat of grease.
    The trays are slightly inclined downwards, and are kept by machinery
    in constant sideways motion backwards and forwards. So accurate is the
    working of this device that few diamonds succeed in getting beyond
    the first tray, and none progress as far as the third, which is added
    as an additional precaution. The whole apparatus is securely covered
    in so that there is no risk of theft during the operation. The trays
    are periodically removed, and the grease is scraped off and boiled to
    release the diamonds, the grease itself being used over again on the
    trays. This is the first time in the whole course of extraction from
    the mines that the diamonds are actually handled. The stones are now
    passed on to the sorters, who separate them into parcels according to
    their size, shape, and quality.</p>

  <p>The classification at the mines is first into groups by the shape:
    (1) close goods, (2) spotted stones, (3) rejection cleavage, (4)
    fine cleavage, (5) light brown cleavage, (6) ordinary and rejection
    cleavage, (7) flats, (8) macles, (9) rubbish, (10) boart. Close goods
    are whole crystals which contain no flaws and can be cut into single
    stones. Spotted stones, as their name suggests, contain spots which
    necessitate removal, and cleavage includes stones which are so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> full of
    flaws that they have to be cleaved or split into two or more stones.
    Flats are distorted octahedra, and macles are twinned octahedra.
    Rubbish is material which can be utilized only for grinding purposes,
    and boart consists of round dark stones which are invaluable for
    rock-drills. These groups are afterwards graded into the following
    subdivisions, depending on increasing depth of yellowish tint: (<i>a</i>)
    blue-white, (<i>b</i>) first Cape, (<i>c</i>) second Cape, (<i>d</i>) first bye, (<i>e</i>)
    second bye, (<i>f</i>) off-colour, (<i>g</i>) light yellow, (<i>h</i>) yellow. It is,
    however, only the first group that is so minutely subdivided. After
    being purchased, the parcels are split up again somewhat differently
    for the London market (cf. <a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>), and the dealers re-arrange the
    stones according to the purpose for which they are required. Formerly
    a syndicate of London merchants took the whole of the produce of the
    Kimberley mines at a previously arranged price per carat, but at
    the present time the diamonds are sold by certain London firms on
    commission.</p>

  <p>The products of each mine show differences in either form or colour
    which enable an expert readily to recognize their origin. The old
    diggings by the Vaal River yielded finer and more colourless stones
    than those found in the dry diggings and the mines underlying them. The
    South African diamonds, taken as a whole, are always slightly yellowish
    or ‘off-coloured’; the mines are, indeed, remarkable for the number of
    fine and large, canary-yellow and brown, stones produced. The Kimberley
    mine yields a fair percentage of white, and a large number of twinned
    and yellow stones. The yield of the De Beers mine comprises mostly
    tinted stones—yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> and brown, occasionally silver capes, and very
    seldom stones free from colour. The Dutoitspan mine is noted for its
    harvest of large yellow diamonds; it also produces fine white cleavage
    and small white octahedra. The stones found in the Bultfontein mine are
    small and spotted, but, on the other hand, the yield has been unusually
    regular. The Premier or Wesselton mine yields a large proportion
    of flawless octahedra, but, above all, a large number of beautiful
    deep-orange diamonds. Of all the South African mines the Jagersfontein
    in the Orange River Colony alone supplies stones of the highly-prized
    blue-white colour and steely lustre characteristic of the old Indian
    stones. The new Premier mine in the Transvaal is prolific, but mostly
    in off-coloured and low-grade stones, the Cullinan diamond being a
    remarkable exception.</p>

  <p>To illustrate the amazing productiveness of the South African mines,
    it may be mentioned that, according to Gardner F. Williams, the
    Kimberley group of mines in sixteen years yielded 36 million carats
    of diamonds, and the annual output of the Jagersfontein mine averages
    about a quarter of a million carats, whereas the total output of the
    Brazil mines, for the whole of the long period during which they have
    been worked, barely exceeds 13 million carats. The average yield of the
    South African mines, however, perceptibly diminishes as the depth of
    the mines increases.</p>

  <p>The most interesting point connected with the South African diamond
    mines, viewed from the scientific standpoint, is the light that they
    have thrown on the question of the origin of the diamond, which
    previously was an incomprehensible and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> apparently insoluble problem.
    In the older mines, just as at the river diggings by the Vaal, the
    stones are found in a gravelly deposit that has resulted from the
    disintegration of the rocks through which the adjacent river has
    passed, and it is clear that the diamond cannot have been formed <i xml:lang="la">in
    situ</i> here; it had been suspected, and now there is no doubt, that the
    itacolumite rock of Brazil has consolidated round the diamonds which
    are scattered through it, and that it cannot be the parent rock. The
    occurrence at Kimberley is very different. These mines are funnels
    which go downwards to unknown depths; they are more or less oval in
    section, becoming narrower with increasing depth, and are evidently the
    result of some eruptive agency. The Kimberley mine has been worked to
    a depth of nearly 4000 feet (1200 m.), and no signs of a termination
    have as yet appeared. The blue ground which fills these ‘pipes,’ as
    they are termed, must have been forced up from below, since it is
    sharply differentiated from the surrounding country rocks. This blue
    ground is a brecciated peridotite of peculiar constitution, to which
    the well-known petrologist, Carvil Lewis, who made a careful study
    of it, gave the name kimberlite. The blue colour testifies to its
    richness in iron, and it is to the oxidation of the iron constituent,
    that the change of colour to yellow in the upper levels is due. Owing
    to the shafts that have been sunk for working the mines, the nature
    of the surrounding rocks is known to some depth. Immediately below
    the surface is a decomposed ferriferous basalt, about 20 to 90 feet
    (6–27 m.) thick, next a black slaty shale, 200 to 250 feet (60–75 m.)
    thick, then 10 feet (3 m.) of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span> conglomerate, next 400 feet (120 m.)
    of olivine diabase, then quartzite, about 400 feet (120 m.) thick,
    and lastly a quartz porphyry, which has not yet been penetrated. The
    strata run nearly horizontal, and there are no signs of upward bending
    at the pipes. The whole of the country, including the mines, was
    covered with a red sandy soil, and there was nothing to indicate the
    wealth that lay underneath. The action of water had in process of time
    removed all signs of eruptive activity. The principal minerals which
    are associated with diamond in the blue ground are magnetite, ilmenite,
    chromic pyrope, which is put on the market as a gem under the misnomer
    ‘Cape-ruby,’ ferriferous enstatite, which also is sometimes cut,
    olivine more or less decomposed, zircon, kyanite, and mica.</p>

  <p>The evidence produced by an examination of the blue ground and the
    walls of the pipes proves that the pipes cannot have been volcanoes
    such as Vesuvius. There is no indication whatever of the action of any
    excessive temperature, while, on the other hand, there is every sign of
    the operation of enormous pressure; the diamonds often contain liquid
    drops of carbonic acid. Crookes puts forward the plausible theory that
    steam has been the primary agency in propelling the diamond and its
    associates up into the channel through which it has carved its way to
    freedom, and holds that molten iron has been the solvent for carbon
    which has crystallized out as diamond under the enormous pressures
    obtaining in remote depths of the earth’s crust. It is pertinent to
    note that, by dissolving carbon in molten iron, the eminent chemist,
    Moissan, was enabled to manufacture tiny diamond crystals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> Water
    trickling down from above would be immediately converted into steam at
    very high pressure on coming into contact with the molten iron, and, in
    its efforts to escape, the steam would drive the iron and its precious
    contents, together with the adjacent rocks, upwards to the surface. The
    ferriferous nature of the blue ground and the yellow tinge so common
    to the diamonds lend confirmation to this theory. The process by which
    the carbon was extracted from shales or other carboniferous rocks and
    dissolved in iron still awaits elucidation.</p>

  <p>Diamonds were found in New South Wales as long ago as 1851 on Turon
    River and at Reedy Creek, near Bathurst, about ninety miles (145 km.)
    from Sydney, but the find was of little commercial importance. A more
    extensive deposit came to light in 1867 farther north at Mudgee. In
    1872 diamonds were discovered in the extreme north of the State, at
    Bingara near the Queensland border. Another discovery was made in 1884
    at Tingha, and still more recently in the tin gravels of Inverell in
    the same region. In their freedom from colour and absence of twinning
    the New South Wales diamonds resemble the Brazilian stones. The average
    size is small, running about five to the carat when cut; the largest
    found weighed nearly 6 carats when cut. They are remarkable for their
    excessive hardness; they can be cut only with their own dust, ordinary
    diamond dust making no impression.</p>

  <p>The Borneo diamonds are likewise distinguished by their exceptional
    hardness. They mostly occur by the river Landak, near Pontianak on the
    west coast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> of the island. They are found in a layer of rather coarse
    gravel, variable, but rarely exceeding a yard (1 m.), in depth, and are
    associated with corundum and rutile, together with the precious metals
    gold and platinum. Indeed, it is no uncommon sight to see natives
    wearing waistcoats ornamented with gold buttons, in each of which a
    diamond is set. The diamonds are well crystallized and generally of
    pure water; yellowish and canary-yellow stones are also common, but
    rose-red, bluish, smoky, and black stones are rare. They seldom exceed
    a carat in weight; but stones of 10 carats in weight are found, and
    occasionally they attain to 20 carats. In 1850 a diamond weighing 77
    carats was discovered. The Rajah of Mattan is said to possess one of
    the purest water weighing as much as 367 carats, but no one qualified
    to pronounce an opinion regarding its genuineness has ever seen it.</p>

  <p>In Rhodesia small diamonds have been found in gravel beds resting on
    decomposed granite near the Somabula forest, about 12 miles (19 km.)
    west of Gwelo, in association with chrysoberyl in abundance, blue
    topaz, kyanite, ruby, sapphire, tourmaline, and garnet.</p>

  <p>The occurrence of diamond in German South-West Africa is very peculiar.
    Large numbers of small stones are found close to the shore near
    Luderitz Bay in a gravelly surface layer, which is nowhere more than a
    foot in depth. They are picked by hand by natives and washed in sieves.
    In shape they are generally six-faced octahedra or twinned octahedra,
    simple octahedra being rare, and in size they run about four or five
    to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> carat, the largest stone as yet found being only 2 carats in
    weight. Their colour is usually yellowish.</p>

  <p>Several isolated finds of diamonds have been reported in California
    and other parts of the United States, but none have proved of any
    importance. The largest stone found weighed 23¾ carats uncut; it was
    discovered at Manchester in Virginia.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE number of diamonds which exceed a hundred carats in weight when
    cut is very limited. Their extreme costliness renders them something
    more than mere ornaments; in a condensed and portable form they
    represent great wealth and all the potentiality for good or ill thereby
    entailed, and have played no small, if sinister, rôle in the moulding
    of history. In bygone days when despotic government was universal, the
    possession of a splendid jewel in weak hands but too often precipitated
    the aggression of a greedy and powerful neighbour, and plunged whole
    countries into the horrors of a ruthless and bloody war. In more
    civilized days a great diamond has often been pledged as security for
    money to replenish an empty treasury in times of stress. The ambitions
    of Napoleon might have received a set-back but for the funds raised
    on the security of the famous Pitt diamond. The history of such
    stones—often one long romance—is full of interest, but space will not
    permit of more than a brief sketch here.</p>

  <p>If we except the colossal Cullinan stone, the mines of Brazil and South
    Africa cannot compare with the old mines of India as the birthplace of
    large and perfect diamonds of world-wide fame.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The history of the famous stone called the Koh-i-nor, meaning Mound of
    Light, is known as far back as the year 1304, when it fell into the
    hands of the Mogul emperors, and legend even traces it back some four
    thousand years previously. It remained at Delhi until the invasion of
    North-West India by Nadir Shah in 1739, when it passed together with an
    immense amount of spoil into the hands of the conqueror. At his death
    the empire which he had so strenuously founded fell to pieces, and
    the great diamond after many vicissitudes came into the possession of
    Runjit Singh at Lahore. His successors kept it until upon the fall of
    the Sikh power in 1850 it passed to the East India Company, in whose
    name it was presented by Lord Dalhousie to Queen Victoria. At this
    date the stone still retained its original Indian form, but in 1862 it
    was re-cut into the form of a shallow brilliant (Fig. 62), the weight
    thereby being reduced from 186<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>
    to 106<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> carats. The wisdom
    of this course has been severely criticized; the stone has not the
    correct shape of a brilliant and is deficient in ‘fire,’ and it has
    with the change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> in shape lost much of its old historical interest.
    The Koh-i-nor is the private property of the English Royal Family, the
    stone shown in the Tower being a model. It is valued at £100,000.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span>—Pitt or Regent (side view).</div>
  </div>

  <p>This splendid stone was discovered in 1701 at the famous diamond mines
    at Partial, on the Kistna, about 150 miles (240 km.) from Golconda,
    and weighed as much as 410 carats in the rough. By devious ways it
    came into the hands of Jamchund, a Parsee merchant, from whom it was
    purchased by William Pitt, governor of Fort St. George, Madras, for
    £20,400. On his return to England Pitt had it cut into a perfect
    brilliant (Fig. 63), weighing 163⅞ carats, the operation occupying
    the space of two years and costing £5000; more than £7000 is said to
    have been realized from the sale of the fragments left over. Pitt
    had an uneasy time and lived in constant dread of theft of the stone
    until, in 1717, after lengthy negotiations, he parted with it to the
    Duc d’Orléans, Regent of France, for the immense sum of three and
    three-quarter million francs, about £135,000. With the remainder of the
    French regalia it was stolen from the Garde-meuble on August 17,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> 1792,
    in the early days of the French Revolution, but was eventually restored
    by the thieves, doubtless because of the impossibility of disposing of
    such a stone, at least intact, and it is now exhibited in the Apollo
    Gallery of the Louvre at Paris. It measures about 30 millimetres in
    length, 25 in width, and 19 in depth, and is valued at £480,000.</p>

  <p>One of the finest diamonds existing, this large stone forms the top
    of the imperial sceptre of Russia. It is rose-cut (Fig. 65), the base
    being a cleavage face, and weighs 194¾ carats. It is said to have
    formed at one time one of the eyes of a statue of Brahma which stood
    in a temple on the island of Sheringham in the Cavery River, near
    Trichinopoli, in Mysore, and to have been stolen by a French soldier
    who had somehow persuaded the priests to appoint him guardian of the
    temple. He sold it for £2000 to the captain of an English ship, who
    disposed of it to a Jewish dealer in London for £12,000. It changed
    hands to a Persian merchant, Raphael Khojeh, who eventually sold it
    to Prince Orloff for, so it is said, the immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> sum of £90,000 and
    an annuity of £4000. It was presented by Prince Orloff to Catherine
    <span class="smcap">II</span> of Russia.</p>

  <h3>(4) <span class="smcap">Great Mogul</span></h3>

  <p>This, the largest Indian diamond known, was found in the Kollur mines,
    about the year 1650. Its original weight is said to have been 787½
    carats, but it was so full of flaws that the Venetian, Hortensio
    Borgis, then in India, in cutting it to a rose form reduced its weight
    to 240 carats. It was seen by Tavernier at the time of his visit
    to India, but it has since been quite lost sight of. It has been
    identified with both the Koh-i-nor and the Orloff, and it is even
    suggested that both these stones were cut from it.</p>

  <h3>(5) <span class="smcap">Sancy</span></h3>

  <p>The history of this diamond is very involved, and probably two or more
    stones have been confused. It may have been the one cut by Berquem for
    Charles the Bold, from whose body on the fatal day of Nancy, in 1477,
    it was snatched by a marauding soldier. It was acquired by Nicholas
    Harlai, Seigneur de Sancy, who sold it to Queen Elizabeth at the close
    of the sixteenth century. A hundred years later, in 1695, it was sold
    by James <span class="smcap">II</span> to Louis <span class="smcap">XIV</span>. The stone in the French
    regalia, according to the inventory taken in 1791, weighed 53¾ carats.
    It was never recovered after the theft of the regalia in the following
    year, but may be identical with the diamond which was in the possession
    of the Demidoff family and was sold by Prince Demidoff in 1865 to
    a London firm who were said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> to have been acting for Sir Jamsetjee
    Jeejeebhoy, a wealthy Parsee of Bombay. It was shown at the Paris
    Exhibition of 1867. It was almond-shaped, and covered all over with
    tiny facets by Indian lapidaries.</p>

  <h3>(6) <span class="smcap">Great Table</span></h3>

  <p>This mysterious stone was seen by Tavernier at Golconda in 1642, but
    has quite disappeared. It weighed 242<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> carats.</p>

  <h3>(7) <span class="smcap">Moon of the Mountains</span></h3>

  <p>This diamond is often confused with the Orloff. It was captured by
    Nadir Shah at Delhi, and after his murder was stolen by an Afghan
    soldier who disposed of it to an Armenian, by name Shaffrass. It was
    finally acquired by the Russian crown for an enormous sum.</p>

  <h3>(8) <span class="smcap">Nizam</span></h3>

  <p>A large diamond, weighing 340 carats, belonged to the Nizam of
    Hyderabad; it was fractured at the beginning of the Indian Mutiny.
    Whether the weight is that previous to fracture or not, there seems to
    be no information.</p>

  <h3>(9) <span class="smcap">Darya-i-nor</span></h3>

  <p>This fine diamond, rose-cut and 186 carats in weight, is of the purest
    water and merits its title of ‘River of Light.’ It seems to have been
    captured by Nadir Shah at Delhi, and is now the largest diamond in the
    Persian collection.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <h3>(10) <span class="smcap">Shah</span></h3>

  <p>This fine stone, of the purest water, was presented to the Czar
    Nicholas by the Persian prince Chosroes, younger son of Abbas Mirza, in
    1843. At that time it still retained three cleavage faces which were
    engraved with the names of three Persian sovereigns, and weighed 95
    carats. It was, however, subsequently re-cut with the loss of 9 carats,
    and the engraving has disappeared in the process.</p>

  <h3>(11) <span class="smcap">Akbar Shah, or Jehan Ghir Shah</span></h3>

  <p>Once the property of the great Mogul, Akbar, this diamond was engraved
    on two faces with Arabic inscriptions by the instructions of his
    successor, Jehan. It disappeared, but turned up again in Turkey
    under the name of ‘Shepherd’s Stone’; it still retained its original
    inscriptions and was thereby recognized. In 1866 it was re-cut, the
    weight being reduced from 116 to 71 carats, and the inscriptions
    destroyed. The stone was sold to the Gaekwar of Baroda for 3½ lakhs of

  <h3>(12) <span class="smcap">Polar Star</span></h3>

  <p>A beautiful, brilliant-cut stone, weighing 40 carats, which is known by
    this name, is in the Russian regalia.</p>

  <h3>(13) <span class="smcap">Nassak</span></h3>

  <p>The Nassak diamond, which weighed 89¾ carats, formed part of the
    Deccan booty, and was put up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> to auction in London in July 1837. It
    was purchased by Emanuel, a London jeweller, who for £7200 shortly
    afterwards sold it to the Duke of Westminster, in whose family it still
    remains. It was originally pear-shaped, but was re-cut to a triangular
    form with a reduction in weight to 78⅝ carats.</p>

  <h3>(14) <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span></h3>

  <p>This diamond was purchased by Napoleon Buonaparte for £8000, and worn
    by him at his wedding with Josephine Beauharnais in 1796.</p>

  <h3>(15) <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span></h3>

  <p>This stone, which weighs 32 carats, was purchased by the city of London
    for £10,000 and presented to the Duke of Cumberland after the battle of
    Culloden; it is now in the possession of the Duke of Brunswick.</p>

  <h3>(16) <span class="smcap">Pigott</span></h3>

  <p>A fine Indian stone, weighing 47½ carats, this diamond was brought
    to England by Lord Pigott in 1775 and sold for £30,000. It came into
    the possession of Ali Pacha, Viceroy of Egypt, and was by his orders
    destroyed at his death.</p>

  <h3>(17) <span class="smcap">Eugénie</span></h3>

  <p>This fine stone, weighing 51 carats, was given by the Czarina Catherine
    <span class="smcap">II</span> of Russia to her favourite, Potemkin. It was purchased
    by Napoleon <span class="smcap">III</span> as a bridal gift for his bride, and on his
    downfall was bought by the Gaekwar of Baroda.</p>

  <h3>(18) <span class="smcap">White Saxon</span></h3>

  <p>Square in contour, measuring 1<span class="fraction"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub></span> in. (28 mm.), and weighing 48¾
    carats, this stone was purchased by Augustus the Strong for a million
    thalers (about £150,000).</p>

  <h3>(19) <span class="smcap">Pacha of Egypt</span></h3>

  <p>This 40-carat brilliant was purchased by Ibrahim, Viceroy of Egypt, for
    £28,000.</p>

  <h3>(20) <span class="smcap">Star of Este</span></h3>

  <p>Though a comparatively small stone, in weight 25½ carats, it is noted
    for its perfection of form and quality. It belongs to the Archduke
    Franz Ferdinand of Austrian-Este, eldest son of the Archduke Karl
    Ludwig.</p>

  <h3>(21) <span class="smcap">Tuscany, or Austrian Yellow</span></h3>

  <p>The beauty of this large stone, 133¾ carats in weight, is marred by
    the tinge of yellow, which is sufficiently pronounced to impair its
    brilliancy; it is a double rose in form. At one time the property of
    the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, it is now in the possession of the Emperor
    of Austria. King mentions a tale that it was bought at a curiosity
    stall in Florence for an insignificant sum, the stone being supposed to
    be only yellow quartz.</p>

  <h3>(22) <span class="smcap">Star of the South</span></h3>

  <p>This, the largest of the Brazilian diamonds, was discovered at the
    mines of Bagagem in July 1853.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> Perfectly transparent and without tint,
    it was dodecahedral in shape and weighed 254½ carats, and was sold in
    the rough for £40,000. It was cut as a perfect brilliant, being reduced
    in weight to 125½ carats.</p>

  <h3>(23) <span class="smcap">English Dresden</span></h3>

  <p>This beautiful stone, which weighed 119½ carats in the rough, was found
    at the Bagagem mines, in Brazil, in 1857, and came into the possession
    of Mr. E. Dresden. It was cut as a long, egg-shaped brilliant, weighing
    76½ carats.</p>

  <h3>(24) <span class="smcap">Star of South Africa</span></h3>

  <p>The first considerable stone to be found in South Africa, it was
    discovered at the Vaal River diggings in 1869, and weighed 83½ carats
    in the rough. It was cut to a triangular brilliant of 46½ carats. It
    was finally purchased by the Countess of Dudley for £25,000.</p>

  <h3>(25) <span class="smcap">Stewart</span></h3>

  <p>This large diamond, weighing in the rough 288⅜ carats, was found at the
    Vaal River diggings in 1872, and was first sold for £6000 and shortly
    afterwards for £9000; it was reduced on cutting to 120 carats. Like
    many South African stones, it has a faint yellowish tinge.</p>

  <h3>(26) <span class="smcap">Porter-Rhodes</span></h3>

  <p>This blue-white stone, which weighed 150 carats, was found in a claim
    belonging to Mr. Porter-Rhodes in the Kimberley mine in February 1880.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

  <h3>(27) <span class="smcap">Imperial, Victoria, or Great White</span></h3>

  <p>This large diamond weighed as much as 457 carats in the rough, and 180
    when cut; it is quite colourless. It was brought to Europe in 1884, and
    was eventually sold to the Nizam of Hyderabad for £20,000.</p>

  <h3>(28) <span class="smcap">De Beers</span></h3>

  <p>A pale yellowish stone, weighing 428½ carats, was found in the De Beers
    mine in 1888. It was cut to a brilliant weighing 228½ carats, and
    was sold to an Indian prince. A still larger stone of similar tinge,
    weighing 503¼ carats, was discovered in 1896, and among other large
    stones supplied by the same mine may be mentioned one of 302 carats
    found in 1884, and another of 409 carats found in early years.</p>

  <h3>(29) <span class="smcap">Excelsior</span></h3>

  <p>This, which prior to the discovery of the ‘Cullinan,’ was by far the
    largest South African stone, was found in the Jagersfontein mine on
    June 30, 1893; bluish-white in tint, it weighed 969½ carats. From
    it were cut twenty-one brilliants, the larger stones weighing 67⅞,
    45<span class="fraction"><sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>,

  <h3>(30) <span class="smcap">Jubilee</span></h3>

  <p>Another large stone was discovered in the Jagersfontein mine in
    1895. It weighed 634 carats in the rough, and from it was obtained a
    splendid, faultless brilliant weighing 239 carats. It was shown at the
    Paris Exhibition of 1900.</p>

  </div>

  <p>All diamonds pale into insignificance when compared with the colossal
    stone that came to light at the Premier mine near Pretoria in the
    Transvaal on January 25, 1905. It was first called the ‘Cullinan’ after
    Sir T. M. Cullinan, chairman of the Premier Diamond Mine (Transvaal)
    Company, but has recently, by desire of King George <span class="smcap">V</span>,
    received the name ‘Star of Africa.’ The rough stone weighed 621·2
    grams or 3025¾ carats (about 1⅓ lb.); it displayed three natural faces
    (P<a href="#Plate_XXV">late XXV</a>) and one large cleavage face, and its shape suggested that
    it was a portion of an enormous stone more than double its size; it was
    transparent, colourless, and had only one small flaw near the surface.
    This magnificent diamond was purchased by the Transvaal Government for
    £150,000, and presented to King Edward <span class="smcap">VII</span> on his birthday,
    November 9, 1907.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Cullinan was entrusted to the famous firm, Messrs. I. J. Asscher
    &amp; Co., of Amsterdam, for cutting on January 23, 1908, just three
    years after its discovery. On February 10 it was cleaved into two
    parts, weighing respectively 1977½ and 1040½ carats, from which the
    two largest stones have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> cut, one being a pendeloque or drop
    brilliant in shape (Fig. 67) and weighing 516½ carats, and the other
    a square brilliant (Fig. 68) weighing 309<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> carats. The first
    has been placed in the sceptre, and the second in the crown of the
    regalia. Besides these there are a pendeloque weighing 92 carats, a
    square-shaped brilliant 62, a heart-shaped stone 18⅜, two marquises
    8<span class="fraction"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>
    and 11¼, an oblong stone 6⅝, a pendeloque
    4<span class="fraction"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span>, and 96
    small brilliants weighing together 7⅜; the total weight of the cut
    stones amounts to 1036<span class="fraction"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> carats. The largest stone has 74 and the
    second 66 facets. The work was completed and the stones handed to King
    Edward in November 1908.</p>

  <p>Although the Premier mine has yielded no worthy compeer of the
    Cullinan, it can, nevertheless, boast of a considerable number of
    large stones which but for comparison with that giant would be thought
    remarkable for their size, no fewer than seven of them having weights
    of over 300 carats, viz. 511, 487¼, 458¾, 391½, 373, 348, and 334
    carats.</p>

  <h3>(32) <span class="smcap">Star of Minas</span></h3>

  <p>This large diamond, which was found in 1911 at the Bagagem mines, Minas
    Geraes, Brazil, had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> shape of a dome with a flat base, and weighed
    in the rough 35·875 grams (174¾ carats).</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>The large stone called the ‘Braganza,’ in the Portuguese regalia, which
    is supposed to be a diamond, is probably a white topaz; it weighs 1680
    carats. The Mattan stone, pear-shaped and weighing 367 carats, which
    was found in the Landak mines near the west coast of Borneo in 1787, is
    suspected to be quartz.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>—Hope.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The largest of coloured diamonds, the Hope, weighs 44⅛ carats, and
    has a steely- or greenish-blue, and not the royal-blue colour of the
    glass models supposed to represent it. It is believed to be a portion
    of a drop-form stone (<i xml:lang="fr">d’un beau violet</i>) which was said to have been
    found at the Kollur mines, and was secured by Tavernier in India in
    1642 and sold by him to Louis <span class="smcap">XIV</span> in 1668; it then weighed 67
    carats. This stone was stolen with the remainder of the French regalia
    in 1792 and never recovered. In 1830 the present stone (Fig. 69) was
    offered for sale by Eliason, a London dealer, and was purchased for
    £18,000 by Thomas Philip Hope, a wealthy banker and a keen collector
    of gems. Probably the apex of the original stone had been cut off,
    reducing it to a nearly square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> stone. The slight want of symmetry of
    the present stone lends confirmation to this view, and two other blue
    stones are known, which, together with the Hope, make up the weight of
    the original stone. At the sale of the Hope collection at Christie’s in
    1867 the blue diamond went to America. In 1908 the owner disposed of it
    to Habib Bey for the enormous sum of £80,000. It was put up to auction
    in Paris in 1909, and bought by Rosenau, the Paris diamond merchant,
    for the comparatively small sum of 400,000 francs (about £16,000), and
    was sold in January 1911 to Mr. Edward M’Lean for £60,000. The stone
    is supposed to bring ill-luck in its train, and its history has been
    liberally embellished with fable to establish the saying.</p>

  <h3>(2) <span class="smcap">Dresden</span></h3>

  <p>A beautiful apple-green diamond, faultless, and of the purest water, is
    contained in the famous Green Vaults of Dresden. It weighs 40 carats,
    and was purchased by Augustus the Strong in 1743 for 60,000 thalers
    (about £9000).</p>

  <p>A fine ruby-red diamond, weighing 10 carats, is included among the

  <p>The lovely orange brilliant, weighing 125⅜ carats, which is in the

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">RANKING in hardness second to diamond alone, the species known to
    science as corundum and widely familiar by the names of its varieties,
    sapphire and ruby, holds a pre-eminent position among coloured
    gem-stones. The barbaric splendour of ruby (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 13) and the
    glorious hue of sapphire (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 11) are unsurpassed, and it
    is remarkable that the same species should boast such different, but
    equally magnificent, tints. They, however, by no means exhaust the
    resources of this variegated species. Fine yellow stones (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>,
    Fig. 12), which compare with topaz in colour and are its superior in
    hardness, and brilliant colourless stones, which are unfortunately
    deficient in ‘fire’ and cannot therefore approach diamond, are to
    be met with, besides others of less attractive hues, purple, and
    yellowish, bluish, and other shades of green. Want of homogeneity in
    the coloration of corundum is a frequent phenomenon; thus, the purple
    stones on close examination are found to be composed of alternate blue
    and red layers, and stones showing patches of yellow and blue colour
    are common. Owing to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> peculiarity of their interior arrangement
    certain stones display when cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i> a vivid six-rayed star of
    light (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 15). Sapphire and ruby share with diamond, pearl,
    and emerald the first rank in jewellery. They are popular stones,
    especially in rings; their comparative rarity in large sizes, apart
    from the question of expense, prevents their use in the bigger articles
    of jewellery. The front of the stones is usually brilliant-cut and the
    back step-cut, but Indian lapidaries often prefer to cover the stone
    with a large number of triangular facets, especially if the stone be
    flawed; star-stones are cut more or less steeply <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>.</p>

  <p>In composition corundum is alumina, oxide of aluminium, corresponding
    to the formula Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but it usually contains in addition small
    quantities, rarely more than 1 per cent., of ferric oxide, chromic
    oxide, and perhaps other metallic oxides. When pure, it is colourless;
    the splendid tints which are its glory have their origin in the minute
    traces of the other oxides present. No doubt chromic oxide is the
    cause of the ruddy hue of ruby, since it is possible, as explained
    above (<a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>), closely to imitate the ruby tint by this means, but
    nothing approaching so large a percentage as 2½ has been detected in
    a natural stone. The blue colour of sapphire may be due to titanic
    oxide, and ferric oxide may be responsible for the yellow hue of
    the ‘oriental topaz,’ as the yellow corundum is termed. Sapphires,
    when of considerable size, are rarely uniform in tint throughout the
    stone. Alternations of blue and red zones, giving rise to an apparent
    purple or violet tint, and the conjunction of patches of blue and
    yellow are common. Perfectly colourless <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>stones are less common, a
    slight bluish tinge being usually noticeable, but they are not in much
    demand because, on account of their lack of ‘fire,’ they are of little
    interest when cut. The tint of the red stones varies considerably in
    depth; jewellers term them, when pale, pink sapphires, but, of course,
    no sharp distinction can be drawn between them and rubies. The most
    highly prized tint is the so-called pigeon’s blood, a shade of red
    slightly inclined to purple. The prices for ruby of good colour run
    from about 25s. a carat for small stones to between £60 and £80 a
    carat for large stones, and still higher for exceptional rubies. The
    taste in sapphires has changed of recent times. Formerly the deep blue
    was most in demand, but now the lighter shade, that resembling the
    colour of corn-flower, is preferred, because it retains a good colour
    in artificial light. Large sapphires are more plentiful than large
    rubies, and prices run lower; even for large perfect stones the rate
    does not exceed £30 a carat. Large and uniform ‘oriental topazes’ are
    comparatively common, and realize moderate prices, about 2s. to 30s.
    a carat according to quality and size. Green sapphires are abundant
    from Australia, but their tint, a kind of deep sage-green, is not very
    pleasing. Brown stones with a silkiness of structure are also known.</p>

  <p>The name of the species comes through the French <i xml:lang="fr">corindon</i> from an
    old Hindu word, <i xml:lang="hi">korund</i>, of unknown significance, and arose from the
    circumstance that the stones which first found their way to Europe came
    from India. At the present day the word corundum is applied in commerce
    to the opaque stones used for abrasive purposes, to distinguish <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>the
    purer material from emery, which is corundum mixed with magnetite and
    other heavy stones of lower hardness. The origin of the word sapphire,
    which means blue, has been discussed in an earlier chapter (<a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>).
    Jewellers use it in a general sense for all corundum except ruby. Ruby
    comes from the Latin <i xml:lang="la">ruber</i>, red. The prefix ‘oriental’ (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>)
    is often used to distinguish varieties of corundum, since it is the
    hardest of ordinary coloured stones and the finest gem-stones in early
    days reached Europe by way of the East.</p>

  <p>Corundum crystallizes either in six-sided prisms terminated by flat
    faces (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 10), which are often triangularly marked, or with
    twelve inclined faces, six above and six below, meeting in a girdle
    (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 14). Ruby favours the former and the other varieties
    the latter type. A fine crystal of ruby—the ‘Edwardes,’ so named by
    the donor, John Ruskin, after Sir Herbert Edwardes—which weighs 33·5
    grams (163 carats), is exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the British
    Museum (Natural History), and is tilted in such a way that the light
    from a neighbouring window falls on the large basal face, and reveals
    the interesting markings that nature has engraved on it. From its type
    of symmetry corundum is doubly refractive with a direction of single
    refraction running parallel to the edge of the prism. Owing to the
    relative purity of the chemical composition the refractive indices
    are very constant; the ordinary index ranges from 1·766 to 1·774 and
    the extraordinary index from 1·757 to 1·765, the double refraction
    remaining always the same, 0·009. The amount of colour-dispersion is
    small, and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> colourless corundum displays very little ‘fire.’
    The difference between the indices for red and blue light is, however,
    sufficiently great that the base of a ruby may be left relatively
    thicker than that of a sapphire to secure an equally satisfactory
    effect (cf. <a href="#Page_98">p. 98</a>)—a point of some importance to the lapidary, since
    stones are sold by weight and it is his object to keep the weight as
    great as possible. When a corundum is tested on the refractometer in
    white light a wide spectrum deliminates the two portions of the field
    because of the smallness of the colour-dispersion (cf <a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>). The
    dichroism of both ruby and sapphire is marked, the twin colours given
    by the former being red and purplish-red, and by the latter blue and
    yellowish-blue, the second colour in each instance corresponding to
    the extraordinary ray. Tests with the dichroscope easily separate ruby
    and sapphire from any other red or blue stone. This character has an
    important bearing on the proper mode of cutting the stones. The ugly
    yellowish tint given by the extraordinary ray of sapphire should be
    avoided by cutting the stone with its table-facet at right angles to
    the prism edge, which is the direction of single refraction. Whether
    a ruby should be treated in the same way is a moot point. No doubt
    if the colour is deep, it is the best plan, because the amount of
    absorption of light is thereby sensibly reduced, but otherwise the
    delightful nuances distinguishing ruby are best secured by cutting
    the table-facet parallel to the direction of single refraction.
    Yellow corundum also shows distinct dichroism, but by a variation
    more of the depth than of the tint of the colour; the phenomenon is
    faint compared with the dichroic effect of a yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> chrysoberyl. The
    specific gravity also is very constant, varying only from 3·95 to 4·10;
    sapphire is on the whole lighter than ruby. Corundum has the symbol 9
    on Mohs’s scale, but though coming next to diamond it is a very poor
    second (cf. <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>). As is usually the case, the application of heat
    tends to lighten the colour of the stones: those of a pale violet or
    a yellow colour lose the tint entirely, and the deep violet stones
    turn a lovely rose colour. On the other hand the action of radium has,
    as was shown by Bordas, an intensifying action on the colour, and
    even develops it in a colourless stone. From the latter reaction it
    may be inferred that often in an apparently colourless stone two or
    more selective influences are at work which ordinarily neutralize one
    another, but, being unequally stimulated by the action of radium, they
    thereupon give rise to colour. The stellate appearance of asterias
    or star-stones—star-ruby and star-sapphire—results from the regular
    arrangement either of numerous small channels or of twin-lamellæ in the
    stone parallel to the six sides of the prisms; light is reflected from
    the interior in the form of a six-rayed star (<a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>). Some stones from
    Siam possess a markedly fibrous or silky structure.</p>

  <p>The synthetical manufacture of ruby, sapphire, and other varieties of
    corundum has already been described (<a href="#Page_116">p. 116</a>).</p>

  <p>Besides its use in jewellery corundum is on account of its hardness of
    great service for many other purposes. Small fragments are extensively
    employed for the bearing parts of the movements of watches, and both
    the opaque corundum and the impure kind known as emery are in general
    use for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span> grinding and polishing softer stones, and steel and other
    metal-work.</p>

  <p>The world’s supply of fine rubies is drawn almost entirely from the
    famous ruby mines near Mogok, situated about 90 miles (145 km.) in
    a north-easterly direction from Mandalay in Upper Burma and at an
    elevation of about 4000 ft. (1200 m.) above sea-level. It is from this
    district that the stones of the coveted carmine-red, the so-called
    ‘pigeon’s blood,’ colour are obtained. The ruby occurs in a granular
    limestone or calcite in association with the spinel of nearly the
    same appearance—the ‘balas-ruby,’ oriental topaz (yellow corundum),
    tourmaline, and occasionally sapphire. Some stones are found in
    the limestone on the sides of the hills, but by far the largest
    quantity occur in the alluvial deposits, both gravel and clay, in the
    river-beds; the ruby ground is locally known as ‘<i>byon</i>.’ The stones
    are as a rule quite small, averaging only about four to the carat.
    Before the British annexation of the country in 1885 the mines were a
    monopoly of the Burmese sovereigns and were worked solely under royal
    licence. They are known to be of great antiquity, but otherwise their
    early history is a mystery. It is said that an astute king secured the
    priceless territory in 1597 from the neighbouring Chinese Shans in
    exchange for a small and unimportant town on the Irrawaddy; if that
    be so, he struck an excellent bargain. The mines were allotted to
    licensed miners, <i>twin-tsas</i> (eaters of the mine) as they were called
    in the language of the country, who not only paid for the privilege,
    but were compelled to hand over to the king all stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> above a certain
    weight. As might be anticipated this injunction caused considerable
    trouble, and the royal monopolists constantly suspected the miners of
    evading the regulation by breaking up stones of exceptional size; from
    subsequent experience, it is probable that large stones were in reality
    seldom found. Since 1887 the mines have been worked by arrangement with
    the Government of India by the Ruby Mines, Ltd., an English company.
    Its career has been far from prosperous, but during recent years, in
    consequence of the improved methods of working the mines and of the
    more generous terms afterwards accorded by the Government, greater
    success has been experienced; the future is, however, to some extent
    clouded by the advent of the synthetical stone, which has even made its
    way out to the East.</p>

  <p>Large rubies are far from common, and such as were discovered in the
    old days were jealously hoarded by the Burmese sovereigns. According to
    Streeter the finest that ever came to Europe were a pair brought over
    in 1875, at a time when the Burmese king was pressed for money. One,
    rich in colour, was originally cushion-shaped and weighed 37 carats;
    the other was a blunt drop in form and weighed 47 carats. Both were cut
    in London, the former being reduced to
    32<span class="fraction"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> carats and the latter
    to 38<span class="fraction"><sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span>
    carats, and were sold for £10,000 and £20,000 respectively.
    A colossal stone, weighing 400 carats, is reported to have been found
    in Burma; it was broken into three pieces, of which two were cut and
    resulted in stones weighing 70 and 45 carats respectively, and the
    third was sold uncut in Calcutta for 7 lakhs of rupees
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> (£46,667). The
    finder of another large stone broke it into two parts, which after
    cutting weighed 98 and 74 carats respectively; he attempted in vain to
    evade the royal acquisitiveness, by giving up the larger stone to the
    king and concealing the other. A fine stone, known by the formidable
    appellation of ‘Gnaga Boh’ (Dragon Lord), weighed 44 carats in the
    rough and 20 carats after cutting. Since the mines were taken over
    by the Ruby Mines, Ltd., a few large stones have been discovered. A
    beautiful ruby was found in the Tagoungnandaing Valley, and weighed
    18½ carats in the rough and 11 carats after cutting; perfectly clear
    and of splendid colour, it was sold for £7000, but is now valued at
    £10,000. Another, weighing 77 carats in the rough, was found in 1899,
    and was sold in India in 1904 for 4 lakhs of rupees (£26,667). A stone,
    weighing 49 carats, was discovered in 1887, and an enormous one,
    weighing as much as 304 carats, in 1890.</p>

  <p>The ruby, as large as a pigeon’s egg, which is amongst the Russian
    regalia was presented in 1777 to the Czarina Catherine by Gustav
    <span class="smcap">III</span> of Sweden when on a visit to St. Petersburg. The large
    red stone in the English regalia which was supposed to be a ruby is a
    spinel (cf <a href="#Page_206">p. 206</a>).</p>

  <p>Comparatively uncommon as sapphires are in the Burma mines a faultless
    stone, weighing as much as 79½ carats, has been discovered there.</p>

  <p>Good rubies, mostly darker in colour than the Burmese stones, are
    found in considerable quantity near Bangkok in Siam, Chantabun
    being the centre of the trade, where, just as in Burma, they are
    intimately associated with the red spinel. Because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> of the difference
    in tint and the consequent difference in price, jewellers draw a
    distinction between Burma and Siam rubies; but that, of course, does
    not signify any specific difference between them. Siam is, however,
    most distinguished as the original home of splendid sapphires. The
    district of Bo Pie Rin in Battambang produces, indeed, more than
    half the world’s supply of sapphires. In the Hills of Precious
    Stones, such being the meaning of the native name for the locality, a
    number of green corundums are found. Siam also produces brown stones
    characterized by a peculiar silkiness of structure. Rubies are found in
    Afghanistan at the Amir’s mines near Kabul and also to the north of the
    lapis lazuli mines in Badakshan.</p>

  <p>The conditions in Ceylon are precisely the converse of those obtaining
    in Burma; sapphire is plentiful and ruby rare in the island. They are
    found in different rocks, sapphire occurring with garnet in gneiss, and
    ruby accompanying spinel in limestone, but they come together in the
    resulting gravels, the principal locality being the gem-district near
    Ratnapura in the south of the island. The largest uncut ruby discovered
    in Ceylon weighed 42½ carats; it had, however, a decided tinge of
    blue in it. Ceylon is also noted for the magnificent yellow corundum,
    ‘oriental topaz,’ or, as it is locally called, ‘king topaz,’ which it
    produces.</p>

  <p>Beautiful sapphires occur in various parts of India, but particularly
    in the Zanskar range of the north-western Himalayas in the state of
    Kashmir, where they are associated with brown tourmaline. Probably most
    of the large sapphires known have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> emanated from India. By far the most
    gigantic ever reported is one, weighing 951 carats, said to have been
    seen in 1827 in the treasury of the King of Ava. The collection at the
    Jardin des Plantes contains two splendid rough specimens; one, known as
    the ‘Rospoli,’ is quite flawless and weighs 132<span class="fraction"><sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub></span> carats, and the
    other is 2 inches in length and 1½ inches in thickness. The Duke of
    Devonshire possesses a fine cut stone, weighing 100 carats, which is
    brilliant-cut above and step-cut below the girdle. An image of Buddha,
    which is cut out of a single sapphire, is exhibited, mounted on a gold
    pin, in the Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History).</p>

  <p>For some years past a large quantity of sapphires have come into the
    market from Montana, U.S.A., especially from the gem-district about
    twelve miles west of Helena. The commonest colour is a bluish green,
    generally pale, but blue, green, yellow and occasionally red stones are
    also found; they are characterized by their almost metallic lustre.
    With them are associated gold, colourless topaz, kyanite, and a
    beautiful red garnet which is found in grains and usually mistaken for
    ruby. Rubies are also found in limestone at Cowee Creek, North Carolina.</p>

  <p>Blue and red corundum, of rather poor quality, has come from the
    Sanarka River, near Troitsk, and from Miask, in the Government of
    Orenburg, Russia, and similar stones have been known at Campolongo, St.
    Gothard, Switzerland.</p>

  <p>The prolific gem-district near Anakie, Queensland, supplies examples of
    every known variety of corundum except ruby; blue, green, yellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> and
    parti-coloured stones, and also star-stones, are plentiful. Leaf-green
    corundum is known father south, in Victoria. The Australian sapphire is
    too dark to be of much value.</p>

  <p>Small rubies and sapphires are found in the gem-gravels near the
    Somabula Forest, Rhodesia.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE species to be considered in this chapter includes the varieties
    emerald and aquamarine, as well as what jewellers understand by beryl.
    It has many incontestable claims on the attention of all lovers of the
    beautiful in precious stones. The peerless emerald (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 5),
    which in its verdant beauty recalls the exquisite lawns that grace the
    courts and quadrangles of our older seats of learning, ranks to-day
    as the most costly of jewels. Its sister stone, the lovely aquamarine
    (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 4), which seems to have come direct from some mermaid’s
    treasure-house in the depths of a summer sea, has charms not to be
    denied. Pliny, speaking of this species, truly says, “There is not a
    colour more pleasing to the eye”; yet he knew only the comparatively
    inferior stones from Egypt, and possibly from the Ural Mountains.
    Emeralds are favourite ring-stones, and would, no doubt, be equally
    coveted for larger articles of jewellery did not the excessive cost
    forbid, and nothing could be more attractive for a central stone than
    a choice aquamarine of deep blue-green hue. Emeralds are usually
    step-cut, though Indian lapidaries often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span> favour the <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>
    form; aquamarines, on the other hand, are brilliant-cut in front and
    step-cut at the back.</p>

  <p>Beryl, to use the name by which the species is known to science, is
    essentially a silicate of aluminium and beryllium corresponding to the
    formula, Be<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>. The beryllia is often partially
    replaced by small amounts of the alkaline earths, caesia, potash, soda,
    and lithia, varying from about 1½ per cent. in beryl from Mesa Grande
    to nearly 5 in that from Pala and Madagascar, and over 6, of which 3·6
    is caesia, in beryl from Hebron, Maine; also, as usual, chromic and
    ferric oxides take the place of a little alumina; from 1 to 2 per cent.
    of water has been found in emerald. The element beryllium was, as its
    name suggests, first discovered in a specimen of this species, the
    discovery being made in 1798 by the chemist Vauquelin; it is also known
    as glucinum in allusion to the sweet taste of its salts.</p>

  <p>When pure, beryl is colourless, but it is rarely, if ever, free
    from a tinge of blue or green. The colour is usually some shade of
    green—grass-green, of that characteristic tint which is in consequence
    known as emerald-green, or blue-green, yellowish green (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig.
    6), and sometimes yellow, pink, and rose-red. The peculiar colour of
    emerald is supposed to be caused by chromic oxide, small quantities
    of which have been detected in it by chemical analysis; moreover,
    experiment shows that glass containing the same percentage amount of
    chromic oxide assumes the same splendid hue. Emerald, on being heated,
    loses water, but retains its colour unimpaired, which cannot therefore
    be due, as has been suggested, to organic matter. The term aquamarine
    is applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">2186</span> to the deep sea-green and blue-green stones, and jewellers
    restrict the term beryl to paler shades and generally other colours,
    such as yellow, golden, and pink, but Kunz has recently proposed the
    name morganite to distinguish the beautiful rose beryl such as is
    found in Madagascar. The varying shades of aquamarine are due to the
    influence of the alkaline earths modified by the presence of ferric
    oxide or chromic oxide; the beautiful blushing hue of morganite is no
    doubt caused by lithia.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>—Emerald<br />Crystal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The name of the species is derived from the Greek <span xml:lang="el">βήρυλλος</span>, an
    ancient word, the meaning of which has been lost in the mists of time.
    The Greek word denoted the same species in part as that now understood
    by the name. Emerald is derived from a Persian word which appeared in
    Greek as <span xml:lang="el">σμάραγδος</span>, and in Latin as <i xml:lang="la">smaragdus</i>; it originally
    denoted chrysocolla, or similar green stone, but was transferred upon
    the introduction of the deep-green beryl from Upper Egypt. The name
    aquamarine was suggested by Pliny’s exceedingly happy description of
    the stones “which imitate the greenness of the clear sea,” although it
    was not actually used by him. That emerald and beryl were one species
    was suspected by Pliny, but the identity was not definitely established
    till about a century ago. Morganite is named after John Pierpont Morgan.</p>

  <p>The natural crystals have the form of a six-sided prism, and in the
    case of emerald (Fig. 70, and <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 8) invariably, if whole,
    end in a single face at right angles to the length of the prism;
    aquamarines have in addition a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> small inclined faces, and
    stones from both Russia and Brazil often taper owing to the effects
    of corrosion. The sixfold character of the crystalline symmetry
    necessarily entails that the double refraction, which is small in
    amount, 0·006, is uniaxial in character, and, since the ordinary
    is greater than the extraordinary refractive index, it is negative
    in sign. The values of the indices range between 1·567 and 1·590,
    and 1·572 and 1·598 respectively, in the two cases, the pink beryl
    possessing the highest values. The dichroism is distinct in the South
    American emerald, the twin colours being yellowish and bluish green,
    but otherwise is rather faint. The specific gravity varies between
    2·69 and 2·79, and is therefore a little higher than that of quartz.
    If, therefore, a beryl and a quartz be floating together in a tube
    containing a suitable heavy liquid, the former will always be at a
    sensibly lower level (cf. Fig. 32). The hardness varies from 7½ to
    8, emerald being a little softer than the other varieties. There is
    no cleavage, but like most gem-stones beryl is very brittle, and can
    easily be fractured. Stones rendered cloudy by fissures are termed
    ‘mossy.’ When heated before the blowpipe beryl is fusible with
    difficulty; it resists the attack of hydrofluoric acid as well as of
    ordinary acids.</p>

  <p>In all probability the whole of the emeralds known in ancient times
    came from the so-called Cleopatra emerald mines in Upper Egypt. For
    some reason they were abandoned, and their position was so completely
    lost that in the Middle Ages it was maintained that emeralds had never
    been found in Egypt at all, but had come from America by way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> of the
    East. All doubts were set at rest by the re-discovery of the mines
    early last century by Cailliaud, who had been sent by the Viceroy of
    Egypt to search for them. They were, however, not much worked, and
    after a few years were closed again, and were re-opened only about ten
    years ago. The principal mines are at Jebel Zabara and at Jebel Sikait
    in northern Etbai, about 10 miles (16 km.) apart and distant about 15
    miles (24 km.) from the Red Sea, lying in the range of mountains that
    run for a long distance parallel to the west coast of the Red Sea and
    rise to over 1800 feet (550 m.) above sea-level. There are numerous
    signs of considerable, but primitive, workings at distinct periods.
    Both emeralds and beryls are found in micaceous and talcose schists.
    The emeralds are not of very good quality, being cloudy and rather
    light in colour. Finer emeralds have been found in a dark mica-schist,
    together with other beryllium minerals, chrysoberyl and phenakite, and
    also topaz and tourmaline on the Asiatic side of the Ural Mountains,
    near the Takowaja River, which flows into the Bolshoi Reft River, one
    of the larger tributaries of the Pyschma River, about fifty miles (80
    km.) east of Ekaterinburg, a town which is chiefly concerned with the
    mining and cutting of gem-stones. The mine was accidentally discovered
    by a peasant, who noticed a few green stones at the foot of an uprooted
    tree in 1830. Two years later the mine was regularly worked, and
    remained open for twenty years, when it was closed. It has recently
    been re-opened owing to the high rates obtaining for emeralds. Very
    large crystals have been produced here, but in colour they are much
    inferior to the South American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> stones; small Siberian emeralds, on the
    other hand, are of better colour than small South American emeralds,
    the latter being not so deep in tint. Emeralds have been found in a
    similar kind of schist at Habachtal, in the Salzburg Alps. About thirty
    years ago well-formed green stones were discovered with hiddenite at
    Stony Point, Alexander County, in North Carolina, but not much gem
    material has come to light.</p>

  <p>The products of none of the mines that have just been mentioned can
    on the whole compare with the beautiful stones which have come from
    South America. At the time when the Spaniards grimly conquered Peru
    and ruthlessly despoiled the country of the treasures which could be
    carried away, immense numbers of emeralds—some of almost incredible
    size—were literally poured into Spain, and eventually found their
    way to other parts of Europe. These stones were known as Spanish or
    Peruvian emeralds, but in all probability none of them were actually
    mined in Peru. Perhaps the most extraordinary were the five choice
    stones which Cortez presented to his bride, the niece of the Duke de
    Bejar, thereby mortally offending the Queen, who had desired them for
    herself, and which were lost in 1529 when Cortez was shipwrecked on
    his disastrous voyage to assist Charles <span class="smcap">V</span> at the siege of
    Algiers. All five stones had been worked to divers fantastic shapes.
    One was cut like a bell with a fine pearl for a tongue, and bore on
    the rim, in Spanish, “Blessed is he who created thee.” A second was
    shaped like a rose, and a third like a horn. A fourth was fashioned
    like a fish, with eyes of gold. The fifth, which was the most valuable
    and the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> remarkable of all, was hollowed out into the form of a
    cup, and had a foot of gold; its rim, which was formed of the same
    precious metal, was engraved with the words, “Inter natos mulierum non
    surrexit major.” As soon as the Spaniards had seized nearly all the
    emeralds that the natives had amassed in their temples or for personal
    adornment, they devoted their attention to searching for the source
    of these marvels of nature, and eventually in 1558 they lighted by
    accident upon the mines in what is now the United States of Colombia,
    which have been worked almost continuously since that time. Since the
    natives, who naturally resented the gross injustice with which they
    had been treated, and penetrated the greed that prompted the actions
    of the Spaniards, hid all traces of the mines, and refused to give any
    information as to their position, it is possible that other emerald
    mines may yet be found. The present mines are situated near the
    village of Muzo, about 75 miles (120 km.) north-north-west of Bogota,
    the capital of Colombia. The emeralds occur in calcite veins in a
    bituminous limestone of Cretaceous age. The Spaniards formerly worked
    the mines by driving adits through the barren rock on the hillsides to
    the gem-bearing veins, but at the present day the open cut method of
    working is employed. A plentiful supply of water is available, which
    is accumulated in reservoirs and allowed at the proper time to sweep
    the debris of barren rock away into the Rio Minero, leaving the rock
    containing the emeralds exposed. Stones, of good quality, which are
    suited for cutting, are locally known as <i xml:lang="es">canutillos</i>, inferior stones,
    coarse or ill-shaped, being called <i xml:lang="es">morallons</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

  <p>Emerald, unlike some green stones, retains its purity of colour in
    artificial light; in fact, to quote the words of Pliny, “For neither
    sun nor shade, nor yet the light of candle, causeth to change and lose
    their lustre.” Many are the superstitions that have been attached to
    it. Thus it was supposed to be good for the eyes, and as Pliny says,
    “Besides, there is not a gem or precious stone that so fully possesseth
    the eye, and yet never contenteth it with satiety. Nay, if the sight
    hath been wearied and dimmed by intentive poring upon anything else,
    the beholding of this stone doth refresh and restore it again.” The
    idea that it was fatal to the eyesight of serpents appears in Moore’s
    lines—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Blinded like serpents when they gaze</div>
        <div class="i1">Upon the emerald’s virgin blaze.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The crystals occur attached to the limestone, and are therefore never
    found doubly terminated. The crystal form is very simple, merely a
    hexagonal prism with a flat face at the one end at right angles to it.
    They are invariably flawed, so much so that a flawless emerald has
    passed into proverb as unattainable perfection. The largest single
    crystal which is known to exist at the present day is in the possession
    of the Duke of Devonshire (Fig. 71). In section it is nearly a regular
    hexagon, about 2 inches (51 mm.) in diameter from side to side, and
    the length is about the same; its weight is 276·79 grams (9¾ oz. Av.,
    or 1347 carats). It is of good colour, but badly flawed. It was given
    to the Duke of Devonshire by Dom Pedro of Brazil, and was exhibited
    at the Great Exhibition of 1851. A fine, though much smaller crystal,
    but of even better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> colour, which weighs 32·2 grams (156½ carats), and
    measures 1⅛ inch (28 mm.) in its widest cross-diameter, and about the
    same in length, was acquired with the Allan-Greg collection by the
    British Museum, and is exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the British
    Museum (Natural History). The finest cut emerald is said to be one
    weighing 30 carats, which belongs to the Czar of Russia. A small, but
    perfect and flawless, faceted emerald, which is set in a gold hoop, is
    also in the British Museum (Natural History). It is shown, without the
    setting, about actual size, on <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 5.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

  <p>The ever great demand and the essentially restricted supply have forced
    the cost of emeralds of good quality to a height that puts large stones
    beyond the reach of all but a privileged few who have purses deep
    enough. The rate per carat may be anything from £15 upwards, depending
    upon the purity of the colour and the freedom from flaws, but it
    increases very rapidly with the size, since flawless stones of more
    than 4 carats or so in weight are among the rarest of jewels; a perfect
    emerald of 4 carats may easily fetch £1600 to £2000. It seems anomalous
    to say that it has never been easier to procure fine stones than during
    recent years, but the reason is that the high prices prevailing have
    tempted owners of old jewellery to realize their emeralds. On the other
    hand, pale emeralds are worth only a nominal sum.</p>

  <p>The other varieties of beryl are much less rare, and, since they
    usually attain to more considerable, and sometimes even colossal, size,
    far larger stones are obtainable. An aquamarine, particularly of good
    deep blue-green colour, is a stone of great beauty, and it possesses
    the merit of preserving its purity of tint in artificial light. It is a
    favourite stone for pendants, brooches, and bracelets, and all purposes
    for which a large blue or green stone is desired. The varying tints are
    said to be due to the presence of iron in different percentages, and
    possibly in different states of oxidation. Unlike emerald, the other
    varieties are by no means so easily recognized by their colour. Blue
    aquamarines may easily be mistaken for topaz, or vice versa, and the
    yellow beryl closely resembles other yellow stones, such as quartz,
    topaz, or tourmaline. Stones which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> colourless or only slightly
    tinted command little more than the price of cutting, but the price of
    blue-green stones rapidly advances with increasing depth of tint up
    to £2 a carat. The enormous cut aquamarine which is exhibited in the
    Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History), affords some
    idea of the great size such stones reach; a beautiful sea-green in
    colour, it weighs 179·5 grams (875 carats), and is table-cut with an
    oval contour.</p>

  <p>The splendid six-sided columns which have been discovered in various
    parts of Siberia are among the most striking specimens in any large
    mineral collection. The neighbourhood of Ekaterinburg in the Urals
    is prolific in varieties of aquamarine; especially at Mursinka have
    fine stones been found, in association with topaz, amethyst, and
    schorl, the black tourmaline. Good stones also occur in conjunction
    with topaz at Miask in the Government of Orenburg. It is found in the
    gold-washings of the Sanarka River, in the Southern Urals, but the
    stones are not fitted for service as gems. Magnificent blue-green and
    yellow aquamarines are associated with topaz and smoky quartz in the
    granite of the Adun-Tschilon Mountains, near Nertschinsk, Transbaikal.
    Stones have also been found at the Urulga River in Siberia. Most
    of the bluish-green aquamarines which come into the market at the
    present time have originated in Brazil, particularly in Minas Novas,
    Minas Geraes, where clear, transparent stones, of pleasing colour, in
    various shades, are found in the utmost profusion; beautiful yellow
    stones also occur at the Bahia mines. Aquamarine was obtained in very
    early times in Coimbatore District,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> Madras, India, and yellow beryl
    comes from Ceylon. Fine blue crystals occur in the granite of the
    Mourne Mountains, Ireland, but they are not clear enough for cutting
    purposes; similar stones are found also at Limoges, Haute Vienne,
    France. Aquamarines of various hues abound in several places in the
    United States, among the principal localities being Stoneham in Maine,
    Haddam in Connecticut, and Pala and Mesa Grande in San Diego County,
    California. The last-named state is remarkable for the numerous stones
    of varying depth of salmon-pink that have been found there. It is,
    however, surpassed by Madagascar, which has recently produced splendid
    stones of perfect rose-red tint and of the finest gem quality, some of
    them being nearly 100 carats in weight. These stones, which have been
    assigned a special name, morganite (cf. <i>supra</i>), are associated with
    tourmaline and kunzite. Pink and yellow beryls and deep blue-green
    aquamarines occur in the island in quantity. The pink beryls from
    California are generally pale or have a pronounced salmon tint, and
    seldom approach the real rose-red colour of morganite; one magnificent
    rose-red crystal, weighing nearly 9 lb. (4·05 kg.), has, however, been
    recently discovered in San Diego County, California, and is now in the
    British Museum (Natural History). Blue-green beryl, varying in tint
    from almost colourless to an emerald-green, occurs with tin-stone and
    topaz about 9 miles (14½ km.) north-east of Emmaville in New South
    Wales, Australia.</p>

  <p>Probably the largest and finest aquamarine crystal ever seen was one
    found by a miner on March 28, 1910, at a depth of 15 ft. (5 m.) in a
    pegmatite vein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> at Marambaya, near Arassuahy, on the Jequitinhonha
    River, Minas Geraes, Brazil. It was greenish blue in colour, and a
    slightly irregular hexagonal prism, with a flat face at each end, in
    form; it measured 19 in. (48·5 cm.) in length and 16 in. (41 cm.) in
    diameter, and weighed 243 lb. (110·5 kg.); and its transparency was so
    perfect that it could be seen through from end to end (<a href="#Plate_XXVI">Plate XXVI</a>). The
    crystal was transported to Bahia, and sold for $25,000 (£5133).</p>

    <div class="headingc">TOPAZ</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TOPAZ is the most popular yellow stone in jewellery, and often
    forms the principal stone in brooches or pendants, especially in
    old-fashioned articles. It is a general idea that all yellow stones
    are topazes, and all topazes are yellow; but neither statement is
    correct. A very large number of yellow stones that masquerade as
    topaz are really the yellow quartz known as citrine. The latter is,
    indeed, almost universally called by jewellers topaz, the qualification
    ‘Brazilian’ being used by them to distinguish the true topaz. Many
    species besides those mentioned yield yellow stones. Thus corundum
    includes the beautiful ‘oriental topaz’ or yellow sapphire, and yellow
    tourmalines are occasionally met with; the yellow chrysoberyl always
    has a greenish tinge. Topaz is generally brilliant-cut in front and
    step-cut at the back, and the table facet is sometimes rounded, but
    the colourless stones are often cut as small brilliants; it takes an
    excellent and dazzling polish.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

  <p>Topaz is a silicate of aluminium corresponding to the formula
    [Al(F,OH)]<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, which was established in 1894 by Penfield and
    Minor as the result of careful research. Contrary to the general
    idea, topaz is usually colourless or very pale in tint. Yellow hues
    of different degrees, from pale to a rich sherry tint (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig.
    9), are common, and pure pale blue (<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>, Fig. 7) and pale green
    stones, which often pass as aquamarine, are far from rare. Natural,
    red and pink, stones are very seldom to be met with. It is, however, a
    peculiarity of the brownish-yellow stones from Brazil that the colour
    is altered by heating to a lovely rose-pink. Curiously, the tint is not
    apparent when the stone is hot, but develops as it cools to a normal
    temperature; the colour seems to be permanent. Such stones are common
    in modern jewellery. Although the change in colour is accompanied by
    some slight rearrangement of the constituent molecules, since such
    stones are invariably characterized by high refraction and pronounced
    dichroism, the crystalline symmetry, however, remaining unaltered,
    the cause must be attributed to some change in the tinctorial agent,
    probably oxidation. The yellow stones from Ceylon, if treated in a
    similar manner, lose their colour entirely. The pale yellow-brown
    stones from Russia fade on prolonged exposure to strong sunlight, for
    which reason the superb suite of crystals from the Urulga River, which
    came with the Koksharov collection to the British Museum, are kept
    under cover.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is derived from <i xml:lang="la">topazion</i> (<span xml:lang="el">τοπάζειν</span>,
    to seek), the name given to an island in the Red Sea, which in olden
    times was with difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> located, but it was applied by Pliny and
    his contemporaries to the yellowish peridot found there. The term
    was applied in the Middle Ages loosely to any yellow stone, and was
    gradually applied more particularly to the stone that was then more
    prevalent, the topaz of modern science. As has already been pointed out
    (<a href="#Page_111">p. 111</a>), the term is still employed in jewellery to signify any yellow
    stone. The true topaz was probably included by Pliny under the name
    <i xml:lang="la">chrysolithus</i>.</p>

  <div class="figright w200">
    <img id="i_199" src="images/i_p199.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>—Topaz Crystal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The symmetry is orthorhombic, and the crystals are prismatic in shape
    and terminated by numerous inclined faces, and usually by a large
    face perpendicular to the prism edge (Fig. 72). Topaz cleaves with
    great readiness at right angles to the prism edge; owing to its facile
    cleavage, flaws are easily started, and caution must be exercised
    not to damage a stone by knocking it against hard and unyielding
    substances. The dichroism of a yellow topaz is always perceptible,
    one of the twin colours being distinctly more reddish than the other,
    and the phenomenon is very marked in the case of stones the colour of
    which has been artificially altered to pink. The values of the least
    and the greatest of the principal indices of refraction vary from 1·615
    to 1·629, and from 1·625 to 1·637, respectively, the double refraction
    being about 0·010 in amount, and positive in sign. The high values
    correspond to the altered stones. The specific gravity, the mean value
    of which is 3·55 with a variation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> 0·05 on either side, is higher
    than would be expected from the refractivity. A cleavage flake exhibits
    in convergent polarized light a wide-angled biaxial picture, the ‘eyes’
    lying outside the field of view. The relation of the principal optical
    directions and the directions of single refraction to the crystal
    are shown in Fig. 27. The hardness is 8 on Mohs’s scale, and in this
    character it is surpassed only by chrysoberyl, corundum, and diamond.
    Topaz is pyro-electric, in which respect tourmaline alone exceeds it,
    and it may be strongly electrified by friction.</p>

  <p>Although the range of refraction overlaps that of tourmaline, there
    is no risk of confusion, because the latter has nearly thrice the
    amount of double refraction (cf. <a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>). Apart from the difference in
    refraction, a yellow topaz ought never to be confused with a yellow
    quartz, because the former sinks, and the latter floats in methylene
    iodide. The same test distinguishes topaz from beryl, and, indeed, from
    tourmaline also.</p>

  <p>Judged by the criterion of price, topaz is not in the first rank of
    precious stones. Stones of good colour and free from flaws are now,
    however, scarce. Pale stones are worth very little, possibly less than
    4s. a carat, but the price rapidly advances with increase in colour,
    reaching 20s. for yellow, 80s. for pink and blue stones. Since topazes
    are procurable in all sizes customary in jewellery, the rates vary but
    slightly, if at all, with the size.</p>

  <p>Topaz occurs principally in pegmatite dykes and in cavities in granite,
    and is interesting to petrologists as a conspicuous instance of the
    result of the action of hot acid vapours upon rocks rich in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> aluminium
    silicates. Magnificent crystals have come from the extensive mining
    district which stretches along the eastern flank of the Ural Mountains,
    and from the important mining region surrounding Nertschinsk, in the
    Government of Transbaikal, Siberia. Fine green and blue stones have
    been found at Alabashka, near Ekaterinburg, in the Government of Perm,
    and at Miask in the Ilmen Mountains, in the Government of Orenburg.
    Topazes of the rare reddish hue have been picked out from the gold
    washings of the Sanarka River, Troitsk, also in the Government of
    Orenburg. Splendid pale-brown stones have issued from the Urulga River,
    near Nertschinsk, and good crystals have come from the Adun-Tschilon
    Mountains. Kamchatka has produced yellow, blue, and green stones. In
    the British Isles, beautiful sky-blue, waterworn crystals have been
    found at Cairngorm, Banffshire, in Scotland, and colourless stones in
    the Mourne Mountains, Ireland, and at St. Michael’s Mount, Cornwall.
    Most of the topazes used in jewellery of the present day come from
    either Brazil or Ceylon. Ouro Preto, Villa Rica, and Minas Novas, in
    the State of Minas Geraes, are the principal localities in Brazil.
    Numerous stones, often waterworn, brilliant and colourless or tinted
    lovely shades of blue and wine-yellow, occur there; reddish stones also
    have been found at Ouro Preto. Ceylon furnishes a profusion of yellow,
    light-green, and colourless, waterworn pebbles. The colourless stones
    found there are incorrectly termed by the natives ‘water-sapphire,’ and
    the light-green stones are sold with beryl as aquamarines; the stones
    locally known as ‘king topaz’ are really yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> corundum (cf. <a href="#Page_181">p. 181</a>).
    Colourless crystals, sometimes with a faint tinge of colour, have
    been discovered in many parts of the world, such as Ramona, San Diego
    County, California, and Pike’s Peak, Colorado, in the United States,
    San Luis Potosi in Mexico, and Omi and Otami-yama in Japan.</p>

    <div class="headingc">SPINEL</div>
    <div class="subhead">(<i>Balas-Ruby</i>, <i>Rubicelle</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">SPINEL labours under the serious disadvantage of being overshadowed at
    almost all points by its opulent and more famous cousins, sapphire and
    ruby, and is not so well known as it deserves to be. The only variety
    which is valued as a gem is the rose-tinted stone called balas-ruby
    (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 3), which is very similar to the true ruby in
    appearance; they are probably often confused, especially since they
    are found in intimate association in nature. Spinels of other colours
    are not very attractive to the eye, and are not likely to be in much
    demand. Blue spinel (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 4) is far from common, but the
    shade is inclined to steely-blue, and is much inferior to the superb
    tint of the true sapphire. Spinel is very hard and eminently suitable
    for a ring-stone, but is seldom large and transparent enough for larger
    articles of jewellery.</p>

  <p>Spinel is an aluminate of magnesium corresponding to the formula
    MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and therefore is closely akin to corundum, alumina, and
    chrysoberyl, aluminate of beryllium. The composition may, however,
    vary considerably owing to the isomorphous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>replacement of one element
    by another; in particular, ferrous oxide or manganese oxide often
    takes the place of some magnesia, and ferric oxide or chromic oxide is
    found instead of part of the alumina. When pure, spinel is devoid of
    colour, but such stones are exceedingly rare. No doubt chromic oxide is
    responsible for the rose-red hue of balas-ruby, and also, when tempered
    by ferric oxide, for the orange tint of rubicelle, and manganese is
    probably the cause of the peculiar violet colour of almandine-spinel.
    It is scarcely possible to define all the shades between blue and red
    that may be assumed by spinel. Stones which are rich in iron are known
    as pleonaste or ceylonite; they are quite opaque, but are sometimes
    used for ornamental wear.</p>

  <p>The name of the species comes from a diminutive form of <span xml:lang="el">σπῖνος</span>, a spark, and refers to the fiery red colour of the most
    valued kind of spinel. It may be noted that the Latin equivalent of
    the word, <i xml:lang="la">carbunculus</i>, has been applied to the crimson garnet when
    cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>. Balas is derived from <i>Balascia</i>, the old name for
    Badakshan, the district from which the finest stones were brought in
    mediæval times.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <img id="i_205" src="images/i_p205.jpg" width="350" height="178" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 73, 74.</span>—Spinel Crystals.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Spinel, like diamond, belongs to the cubic system of crystalline
    symmetry, and occurs in beautiful octahedra, or in flat
    triangular-shaped plates (Figs. 73, 74) the girdles of which are
    cleft at each corner, these plates being really twinned octahedra.
    The refraction is, of course, single, and there is therefore no
    double refraction or dichroism; this test furnishes the simplest
    way of discriminating between the balas and the true ruby. Owing to
    isomorphous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> replacement the value of the refractive index may lie
    anywhere between 1·716 and 1·736. The lower values, about 1·720,
    correspond to the most transparent red and blue stones; the deep
    violet stones have values above 1·730. Spinel possesses little
    colour-dispersion, or ‘fire.’ In the same way the values of the
    specific gravity, even of the transparent stones, vary between 3·5
    and 3·7, but the opaque ceylonite has values as high as 4·1. Spinel
    is slightly softer than sapphire and ruby, and has the symbol 8 on
    Mohs’s scale, and it is scarcely inferior in lustre to these stones.
    Spinel is easily separated from garnet of similar colour by its lower
    refractivity. Spinels run from 10s. to £5 a carat, depending on their
    colour and quality, and exceptional stones command a higher rate.</p>

  <p>Spinel always occurs in close association with corundum. The balas
    and the true ruby are mixed together in the limestones of Burma and
    Siam. Curiously enough, the spinel despite its lower hardness is found
    in the river gravels in perfect crystals, whereas the rubies are
    generally waterworn. Fine violet and blue spinels occur in the prolific
    gem-gravels of Ceylon. A large waterworn octahedron and a rough mass,
    both of a fine red colour, are exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the
    British Museum (Natural History), and a beautiful faceted blue stone is
    shown close by.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

  <p>The enormous red stone, oval in shape, which is set in front of the
    English crown, is not a ruby, as it was formerly believed to be, but
    a spinel. It was given to the gallant Black Prince by Pedro the Cruel
    after the battle of Najera in 1367, and was subsequently worn by Henry
    <span class="smcap">V</span> upon his helmet at the battle of Agincourt. As usual with
    Indian-fashioned stones it is pierced through the middle, but the hole
    is now hidden by a small stone of similar colour.</p>

  <p>The British Regalia also contains the famous stone called the Timur
    Ruby or Khiraj-i-Alam (Tribute of the World), which weighs just over
    352 carats, and is the largest spinel-ruby known. It is uncut, but
    polished. Its history goes back to 1398, when it was captured by the
    Amir Timur at Delhi. On the wane of the Tartar empire the stone became
    the property of the Shahs of Persia, until it was given by Abbas
    <span class="smcap">I</span> to his friend and ally, the Mogul Emperor, Jehangir. It
    remained at Delhi until, on the sack of that city by Nadir Shah in
    1739, it, together with immense booty, including the Koh-i-nor, fell
    into the hands of the conqueror. Like the great diamond, it eventually
    came into the possession of Runjit Singh at Lahore, and on the
    annexation of the Punjab in 1850 passed to the East India Company. It
    was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and afterwards presented to
    Queen Victoria.</p>

  <p>Mention has been made above (<a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>) of the blue spinel which is
    manufactured in imitation of the true sapphire. The artificial stone is
    quite different in tint from the blue spinel found in nature.</p>

      <div class="headingc">GARNET</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE important group of minerals which are known under the general name
    of garnet provides an apt illustration of the fact that rarity is an
    essential condition if a stone is to be accounted precious. Owing to
    the large quantity of Bohemian garnets, of a not very attractive shade
    of yellowish red, that have been literally poured upon the market
    during the past half-century the species has become associated with
    cheap and often ineffective jewellery, and has acquired a stigma which
    completely prevents its attaining any popularity with those professing
    a nice taste in gem-stones. It must not, however, be supposed that
    garnet has entirely disappeared from high-class jewellery although the
    name may not readily be found in a jeweller’s catalogue. Those whose
    business it is to sell gem-stones are fully alive to the importance of
    a name, and, as has already been remarked (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>), they have been fain
    to meet the prejudices of their customers by offering garnets under
    such misleading guises as ‘Cape-ruby,’ ‘Uralian emerald,’ or ‘olivine.’</p>

  <p>Garnets may, moreover, figure under another name quite unintentionally.
    Probably many a fine stone masquerades as a true ruby; the
    impossibility of distinguishing these two species in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> certain cases by
    eye alone is perhaps not widely recognized. An instructive instance
    came under the writer’s notice a few years ago. A lady one day had
    the misfortune to fracture one of the stones in a ruby ring that had
    been in the possession of her family for upwards of a century, and
    was originally purchased of a leading firm of jewellers in London.
    She took the ring to her jeweller, and asked him to have the stone
    replaced by another ruby. A day or two later he sent word that it was
    scarcely worth while to put a ruby in because the stones in the ring
    were paste. Naturally distressed at such an opinion of a ring which had
    always been held in great esteem by her family, the lady consulted a
    friend, who suggested showing it to the writer. A glance was sufficient
    to prove that if the ring had been in use so long the stones could not
    possibly be paste on account of the excellent state of their polish,
    but a test with the refractometer showed that the stones were really
    almandine-garnets, which so often closely resemble the true ruby in
    appearance. Beautiful as the stones were, the ring was probably not
    worth one-tenth what the value would have been had the stones been
    rubies.</p>

  <p>To the student of mineralogy garnet is for many reasons of peculiar
    interest. It affords an excellent illustration of the facility which
    certain elements possess for replacing one another without any great
    disturbance of the crystalline form. Despite their apparent complexity
    in composition all garnets conform to the same type of formula: lime,
    magnesia, and ferrous and manganese oxides, and again alumina and
    ferric and chromic oxides may replace each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> in any proportion,
    iron being present in two states of oxidation, and it would be rare
    to find a stone which agrees in composition exactly with any of the
    different varieties of garnet given below.</p>

  <div class="figright">
    <img id="i_209" src="images/i_p209.jpg" width="350" height="176" alt="" />
    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figs. 75, 76.</span>—Garnet Crystals.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Garnet belongs to the cubic system of crystalline symmetry.
    Its crystals are commonly of two kinds, both of which are very
    characteristic, the regular dodecahedron, <i>i.e.</i> twelve-faced figure
    (Fig. 75), and the tetrakis-octahedron or three-faced octahedron (Fig.
    76); the latter crystals are, especially when weather- or water-worn,
    almost spherical in shape. Closer and more refined observations have
    shown that garnet is seldom homogeneous, being usually composed of
    several distinct individuals of a lower order of symmetry. Although
    singly refractive as far as can be determined with the refractometer or
    by deviation through a prism, yet when examined under the polarizing
    microscope, garnets display invariably a small amount of local double
    refraction. The transition from light to darkness is, however, not
    sharp as in normal cases, but is prolonged into a kind of twilight.
    In hardness, garnet is on the whole about the same as quartz, but
    varies slightly; hessonite and andradite are a little softer, pyrope,
    spessartite, and almandine are a little harder, while uvarovite is
    almost the same. All the varieties except uvarovite are fusible when
    heated before the blowpipe, and small fragments melt sufficiently on
    the surface in the ordinary bunsen flame to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span> adhere to the platinum
    wire holding them. This test is very useful for separating rough red
    garnets, pyrope or almandine, from red spinels or zircons of very
    similar appearance. Far greater variation occurs in the other physical
    characters. The specific gravity may have any value between 3·55 and
    4·20, and the refractive index ranges between 1·740 and 1·890. Both the
    specific gravity and the refractive index increase on the whole with
    the percentage amount of iron.</p>

  <p>Garnet is a prominent constituent of many kinds of rocks, but the
    material most suitable for gem purposes occurs chiefly in crystalline
    schists or metamorphic limestones. Pyrope and demantoid are furnished
    by peridotites and the serpentines resulting from them; almandine and
    spessartite come mostly from granites.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is derived from the Latin <i xml:lang="la">granatus</i>,
    seed-like, and is suggested by the appearance of the spherical crystals
    when embedded in their pudding-like matrix.</p>

  <p>The varieties most adapted to jewellery are the fiery-red pyrope and
    the crimson and columbine-red almandine; the closer they approach the
    ruddy hue of ruby the better they are appreciated. Hessonite was at one
    time in some demand, but it inclines too much to the yellowish shade
    of red and possesses too little perfection of transparency to accord
    with the taste of the present day. Demantoid provides beautiful, pale
    and dark emerald-green stones, of brilliant lustre and high dispersion,
    which are admirably adapted for use in pendants or necklaces; on
    account of their comparative softness it would be unwise to risk them
    in rings. In many stones the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> colour takes a yellowish shade, which
    is less in demand. Uvarovite also occurs in attractive emerald-green
    stones, but unfortunately none as yet have been found large enough for
    cutting. A few truly magnificent spessartites are known—one, a splendid
    example, weighing 6¾ carats, being in the possession of Sir Arthur
    Church; but the species is far too seldom transparent to come into
    general use. The price varies per carat from 2s. for common garnet to
    10s. for stones most akin to ruby in colour, and exceptional demantoids
    may realize even as much as £10 a carat. The old style of cutting was
    almost invariably rounded or <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, but at the present day the
    brilliant-cut front and the step-cut back is most commonly adopted.</p>

  <p>The several varieties will now be considered in detail.</p>

  <h3>(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Hessonite</span></h3>

  <div class="center">(<i>Grossular</i>, <i>Cinnamon-Stone</i>, <i>Hyacinth</i>, <i>Jacinth</i>)</div>

  <p>This variety, strictly a calcium-aluminium garnet corresponding to
    the formula Ca<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, but generally containing some
    ferric oxide and therefore tending towards andradite, is called by
    several different names. In science it is usually termed grossular, a
    word derived from <i>grossularia</i>, the botanical name for gooseberry, in
    allusion to the colour and appearance of many crystals, or hessonite,
    and less correctly essonite, words derived from the Greek <span xml:lang="el">ἥσσων</span>
    in reference to the inferior hardness of these stones as
    compared with zircon of similar colour; in jewellery it is better
    known as cinnamon-stone, if a golden-yellow in colour, or hyacinth or
    jacinth. The last word, which is indiscriminately <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>used for hessonite
    and yellow zircon, but should more properly be applied to the latter,
    is derived from an old Indian word (cf. <a href="#Page_229">p. 229</a>); jewellers, however,
    retain it for the garnet.</p>

  <p>Only the yellow and orange shades of hessonite (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 5)
    are used for jewellery. Neither the brownish-green kind, to which the
    term grossular may properly be applied, nor the rose-red is transparent
    enough to serve as a gem-stone. Hessonite may mostly be recognized,
    even when cut, by the curiously granular nature of its structure, just
    as if it were composed of tiny grains imperfectly fused together; this
    appearance, which is very characteristic, may readily be perceived if
    the interior of the stone be viewed through a lens of moderate power.</p>

  <p>The specific gravity varies from 3·55 to 3·66, and the refractive index
    from 1·742 to 1·748. The hardness is on the whole slightly below that
    of quartz. When heated before a blowpipe it easily fuses to a greenish
    glass.</p>

  <p>The most suitable material is found in some profusion in the
    gem-gravels of Ceylon, in which it is mixed up with zircon of an almost
    identical appearance; both are called hyacinth. Hessonites from other
    localities, although attractive as museum specimens, are not large and
    clear enough for cutting purposes. Switzerland at one time supplied
    good stones, but the supply has long been exhausted.</p>

  <h3>(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">Pyrope</span></h3>

  <div class="center">(‘<i>Cape-Ruby</i>’)</div>

  <p>Often quite ruby-red in colour (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 6), this variety
    is probably the most popular of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> the garnets. It is strictly
    a magnesium-aluminium garnet corresponding to the formula
    Mg<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, but usually contains some ferrous oxide
    and thus approaches almandine. Both are included among the precious
    garnets. Its name is derived from <span xml:lang="el">πυρωπός</span>, fire-like, in
    obvious allusion to its characteristic colour.</p>

  <p>Although at its best pyrope closely resembles ruby, its appearance is
    often marred by a tinge of yellow which decidedly detracts from its
    value. Pyrope generally passes as a variety of ruby, and under such
    names as ‘Cape-ruby,’ ‘Arizona-ruby,’ depending on the origin of the
    stones, commands a brisk sale. The specific gravity varies upwards
    from 3·70, depending upon the percentage amount of iron present, and
    similarly the refractive index varies upwards from 1·740; in the higher
    values pyrope merges into almandine. Its hardness is slightly greater
    than that of quartz, and may be expressed on Mohs’s scale by the symbol
    7¼.</p>

  <p>An enormous quantity of small red stones, mostly with a slight tinge of
    yellow, have been brought to light at Teplitz, Aussig, and other spots
    in the Bohemian Mittelgebirge, and a considerable industry in cutting
    and marting them has grown up at Bilin. Fine ruby-red stones accompany
    diamond in the ‘blue ground’ of the mines at Kimberley and also at the
    Premier mine in the Transvaal. Similar stones are also found in Arizona
    and Colorado in the United States, and in Australia, Rhodesia, and
    elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Although commonly quite small in size, pyrope has occasionally attained
    to considerable size. According to De Boodt the Kaiser Rudolph II had
    one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> in his possession valued at 45,000 thalers (about £6750). The
    Imperial Treasury at Vienna contains a stone as large as a hen’s egg.
    Another about the size of a pigeon’s egg is in the famous Green Vaults
    at Dresden, and the King of Saxony has one, weighing 468½ carats, set
    in an Order of the Golden Fleece.</p>

  <h3>(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">Rhodolite</span></h3>

  <p>This charming pale-violet variety was found at Cowee Creek and at
    Mason’s Branch, Macon County, North Carolina, U.S.A., but in too
    limited amount to assume the position in jewellery it might otherwise
    have expected. In composition it lies between pyrope and almandine,
    and may be supposed to contain a proportion of two molecules of the
    former to one of the latter. Its specific gravity is 3·84, refractive
    index 1·760, and hardness 7¼. It exhibits in the spectroscope the
    absorption-bands characteristic of almandine.</p>

  <h3>(<i>d</i>) <span class="smcap">Almandine</span></h3>

  <div class="center">(<i>Carbuncle</i>)</div>

  <p>This variety is iron-aluminium garnet corresponding to the formula
    Fe<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, but the composition is very variable. In
    colour it is deep crimson and violet or columbine-red (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig.
    8), but with increasing percentage amount of ferric oxide it becomes
    brown and black, and opaque, and quite unsuitable for jewellery. The
    name of the variety is a corruption of Alabanda in Asia Minor, where
    in Pliny’s time the best red stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> were cut. Almandine is sometimes
    known as Syriam, or incorrectly Syrian garnet, because at Syriam, once
    the capital of the ancient kingdom of Pegu, which now forms part of
    Lower Burma, such stones were cut and sold. Crimson stones, cut in the
    familiar <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i> form and known as carbuncles, were extensively
    employed for enriching metalwork, and a half-century or so ago were
    very popular for ornamental wear, but their day has long since gone.
    Such glowing stones are aptly described by their name, which is derived
    from the Latin <i xml:lang="la">carbunculus</i>, a little spark. In Pliny’s time, however,
    the term was used indiscriminately for all red stones. It has already
    been remarked that the word spinel has a similar significance.</p>

  <p>The specific gravity varies from 3·90 for transparent stones to 4·20
    for the densest black stones, and the refractive index may be as high
    as 1·810. Almandine is one of the hardest of the garnets, and is
    represented by the symbol 7½ on Mohs’s scale. The most interesting and
    curious feature of almandine lies in the remarkable and characteristic
    absorption-spectrum revealed when the transmitted light is examined
    with a spectroscope (<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>). The phenomenon is displayed most vividly
    by the violet stones, and is, indeed, the cause of their peculiar
    colour.</p>

  <p>Although a common mineral, almandine of a quality fitted for jewellery
    occurs in comparatively few localities. It is found in Ceylon, but
    not so plentifully as hessonite. Good stones are mined in various
    parts of India, and are nearly all cut at Delhi or Jaipur. Brazil
    supplies good material, especially in the Minas Novas district of
    Minas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> Geraes, where it accompanies topaz, and Uruguay also furnishes
    serviceable stones. Almandine is found in Australia, and in many parts
    of the United States. Recently small stones of good colour have been
    discovered at Luisenfelde in German East Africa.</p>

  <h3>(<i>e</i>) <span class="smcap">Spessartite</span></h3>

  <p>Properly a manganese-aluminium garnet corresponding to the formula
    Mn<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, this variety generally contains iron in
    both states of oxidation. If only transparent and large enough its
    aurora-red colour would render it most acceptable in jewellery. Two
    splendid stones have, indeed, been found in Ceylon (<a href="#Page_211">p. 211</a>), and good
    stones rather resembling hessonites have been quarried at Amelia
    Court House in Virginia, and others have come from Nevada; otherwise,
    spessartite is unknown as a gem-stone.</p>

  <p>The specific gravity ranges from 4·0 to 4·3, and the refractive index
    is about 1·81, both characters being high; the hardness is slightly
    greater than that of quartz.</p>

  <h3>(<i>f</i>) <span class="smcap">Andradite</span></h3>

  <div class="center">(<i>Demantoid</i>, <i>Topazolite</i>, ‘<i>Olivine</i>’)</div>

  <p>Andradite is strictly a calcium-iron garnet corresponding to the
    formula Ca<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, but as usual the composition varies
    considerably. It is named after d’Andrada, a Portuguese mineralogist,
    who made a study of garnet more than a century ago.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

  <p>Once contemptuously styled common garnet, andradite suddenly sprang
    into the rank of precious stones upon the discovery some thirty
    years ago of the brilliant, green stones (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 7) in the
    serpentinous rock beside the Bobrovka stream, a tributary of the
    Tschussowaja River, in the Sissersk district on the western side of
    the Ural Mountains. The shade of green varies from olive through
    pistachio to a pale emerald, and is probably due to chromic oxide. Its
    brilliant lustre, almost challenging that of diamond, and its enormous
    colour-dispersion, in which respect it actually transcends diamond,
    raise it to a unique position among coloured stones. Unfortunately
    its comparative softness limits it to such articles of jewellery as
    pendants and necklaces, where it is not likely to be rubbed. When first
    found it was supposed to be true emerald, which does actually occur
    near Ekaterinburg, and was termed ‘Uralian emerald.’ When analysis
    revealed its true nature, it received from science the slightly
    inharmonious name of demantoid in compliment to its adamantine lustre.
    Jewellers, however, prefer to designate it ‘olivine,’ not very happily,
    because the stones usually cut are not olive-green and the name is
    already in extensive use in science for a totally distinct species (<a href="#Page_225">p.
    225</a>); they recognized the hopelessness of endeavouring to find a market
    for them as garnets. The yellow kind of andradite known as topazolite
    would be an excellent gem-stone if only it were found large and
    transparent enough. Ordinary andradite is brown or black, and opaque;
    it has occasionally been used for mourning jewellery.</p>

  <p>The specific gravity varies from 3·8 to 3·9, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> about 3·85 for
    demantoid, which has a high refractive index, varying from 1·880 to
    1·890, and may with advantage be cut in the brilliant form. It is the
    softest of the garnets, being only 6½ on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <h3>(<i>g</i>) <span class="smcap">Uvarovite</span></h3>

  <p>This variety, which is altogether unknown in jewellery, is
    a calcium-iron garnet corresponding mainly to the formula
    Ca<sub>3</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, but with some alumina always present, and
    was named after a Russian minister. It has an attractive green colour,
    and is, moreover, hard, being about on Mohs’s scale, but it has never
    yet come to light of a size suitable for cutting. The specific gravity
    is low, varying from 3·41 to 3·52. Unlike the kindred varieties it
    cannot be fused by heating before an ordinary blowpipe.</p>

    <div class="headingc">TOURMALINE</div>
    <div class="subhead">(<i>Rubellite</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TOURMALINE is unsurpassed even by corundum in variety of hue, and
    it has during recent years rapidly advanced in public favour,
    mainly owing to the prodigal profusion in which nature has formed
    it in that favoured State, California, the garden of the west. Its
    comparative softness militates against its use in rings, but its
    gorgeous coloration renders it admirably fitted for service in any
    article of jewellery, such as a brooch or a pendant, in which a large
    central stone is required. Like all coloured stones it is generally
    brilliant-cut in front and step-cut at the back, but occasionally it is
    sufficiently fibrous in structure to display, when cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>,
    pronounced chatoyancy.</p>

  <p>The composition of this complex species has long been a vexed
    question among mineralogists, but considerable light was
    recently thrown on the subject by Schaller, who showed that all
    varieties of tourmaline may be referred to a formula of the type
    12SiO<sub>2</sub>.3B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.(9-<i>x</i>)[(Al,Fe)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>].3<i>x</i>[(Fe,Mn,Ca,Mg,K<sub>2</sub>,Na<sub>2</sub>,Li<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>)O].3H<sub>2</sub>O.
    The ratios of boric oxide,
    silica, and water are nearly constant in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> analyses, but great
    variation is possible in the proportions of the other constituents.
    Having regard to this complexity, it is not surprising to find that
    the range in colour is so great. Colourless stones, to which the name
    achroite is sometimes given, were at one time exceedingly rare, but
    they are now found in greater number in California. Stones which are
    most suited to jewellery purposes are comparatively free from iron, and
    apparently owe their wonderful tints to the alkaline earths; lithia,
    for instance, is responsible for the beautiful tint of the highly
    prized rubellite, and magnesia, no doubt, for the colour of the brown
    stones of various tints. Tourmaline rich in iron is black and almost
    opaque. It is a striking peculiarity of the species that the crystals
    are rarely uniform in colour throughout, the boundaries between the
    differently coloured portions being sharp and abrupt, and the tints
    remarkably in contrast. Sometimes the sections are separated by planes
    at right angles to the length of the crystal, and sometimes they are
    zonal, bounded by cylindrical surfaces running parallel to the same
    length. In the latter case a section perpendicular to the length shows
    zones of at least three contrasting tints. In the Brazilian stones the
    core is generally red, bounded by white, with green on the exterior,
    while the reverse is the case in the Californian stones, the core being
    green or yellow, bounded by white, with red on the exterior. Tourmaline
    may, indeed, be found of almost every imaginable tint, except,
    perhaps, the emerald green and the royal sapphire-blue. The principal
    varieties are rose-red and pink (rubellite) (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 1),
    green (Brazilian emerald),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span> indigo-blue (indicolite), blue (Brazilian
    sapphire), yellowish green (Brazilian peridot) (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 2),
    honey-yellow (Ceylonese peridot), violet-red (siberite), and brown
    (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 8). The black, opaque stones are termed schorl.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is derived from the Ceylonese word, <i xml:lang="si">turamali</i>,
    and was first employed when a parcel of gem-stones was brought to
    Amsterdam from Ceylon in 1703; in Ceylon, however, the term is applied
    by native jewellers to the yellow zircon commonly found in the island.
    Schorl, the derivation of which is unknown, is the ancient name for the
    species, and is still used in that sense by miners, but it has been
    restricted by science to the black variety. The ‘Brazilian emerald’
    was introduced into Europe in the seventeenth century and was not
    favourably received, possibly because the stones were too dark in
    colour and were not properly cut; that they should have been confused
    with the true emerald is eloquent testimony to the extreme ignorance
    of the characters of gem-stones prevalent in those dark ages. Achroite
    comes from the Greek, <span xml:lang="el">ἄχροος</span>, without colour.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>—Tourmaline<br />Crystal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>To the crystallographer tourmaline is one of the most interesting of
    minerals. If the crystals, which are usually prismatic in form, are
    doubly terminated, the development is so obviously different at the
    two ends (Fig. 77) as to indicate that directional character in the
    molecular arrangement, termed the polarity, which is borne out by other
    physical properties. Tourmaline is remarkably dichroic, A brown stone,
    except in very thin sections, is practically opaque to the ordinary
    ray, and consequently a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> section cut parallel to the crystallographic
    axis, <i>i.e.</i> to the length of a crystal prismatically developed,
    transmits only the extraordinary ray. Such sections were in use for
    yielding plane-polarized light before Nicol devised the calcite prism
    known by his name (cf. <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>). It is evident that tourmaline, unless
    very light in tint, must be cut with the table facet parallel to that
    axis, because otherwise the stone will appear dark and lifeless. The
    values of the extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices range
    between 1·614 and 1·638, and 1·633 and 1·669 respectively; the double
    refraction, therefore, is fairly large, amounting to 0·025, and,
    since the ordinary exceeds the extraordinary ray, its character is
    negative. The specific gravity varies from 3·0 to 3·2. The lower values
    in both characters correspond to the lighter coloured stones used in
    jewellery; the black stones, as might be expected from their relative
    richness in iron, are the densest. The hardness is only about the same
    as that of quartz, or perhaps a little greater, varying from 7 to 7½.
    It will be noticed that the range of refractivity overlaps that of
    topaz (<i>q.v.</i>) but the latter has a much smaller double refraction,
    and may thus be distinguished (<a href="#Page_29">p. 29</a>). Unmounted stones are still more
    easily distinguished, because tourmaline floats in methylene iodide,
    while topaz sinks. The pyro-electric phenomenon (cf. <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>) for which
    tourmaline is remarkable, although of little value as a test in the
    case of a cut stone, is of great scientific interest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> because it is
    strong evidence of the peculiar crystalline symmetry pertaining to its
    molecular arrangement. Tourmalines range in price from 5s. to 20s. a
    carat according to their colour and quality, but exceptional stones may
    command a higher rate.</p>

  <p>Tourmaline is usually found in the pegmatite dykes of granites, but
    it also occurs in schists and in crystalline limestones. Rubellite
    is generally associated with the lithia mica, lepidolite; the groups
    of delicate pink rubellite bespangling a background of greyish
    white lepidolite are among the most beautiful of museum specimens.
    Magnificent crystals of pink, blue, and green tourmaline have been
    found in the neighbourhood of Ekaterinburg, principally at Mursinka, in
    the Urals, Russia, and fine rubellite has come from the Urulga River,
    and other spots near Nertschinsk, Transbaikal, Asiatic Russia. Elba
    produces pink, yellowish, and green stones, frequently particoloured;
    sometimes the crystals are blackened at the top, and are then known
    locally as ‘nigger-heads.’ Ceylon supplies small yellow stones—the
    original tourmaline—which are confused with the zircon of a similar
    colour, and rubellite accompanies the ruby at Ava, Burma. Beautiful
    crystals, green and red, often diversely coloured, come from various
    parts, such as Minas Novas and Arassuahy, of the State of Minas Geraes,
    Brazil. Suitable gem material has been found in numerous parts of
    the United States. Paris and Hebron in Maine have produced gorgeous
    pink and green crystals, and Auburn in the same state has supplied
    deep-blue, green, and lilac stones. Fine crystals, mostly green, but
    also pink and particoloured, occur in an albite quarry near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span> Conn
    River at Haddam Neck, Connecticut. All former localities have, however,
    been surpassed by the extraordinary abundance of superb green, and
    especially pink, crystals at Pala and Mesa Grande in San Diego County,
    California. As elsewhere, many-hued stones are common. The latter
    locality supplies the more perfectly transparent crystals. Kunz states
    that two remarkable rubellite crystals were found there, one being 45
    mm. in length and 42 mm. in diameter, and the other 56 mm. in length
    and 24 mm. in diameter. Madagascar, which has proved of recent years
    to be rich in gem-stones, supplies green, yellow, and red stones, both
    uniformly tinted and particoloured, which in beauty, though perhaps not
    in size, bear comparison with any found elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="headingc">PERIDOT</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE beautiful bottle-green stone, which from its delicate tint has
    earned from appreciative admirers the poetical <i xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i> of the
    evening emerald, and which has during recent years crept into popular
    favour and now graces much of the more artistic jewellery, is named
    as a gem-stone peridot—a word long in use among French jewellers, the
    origin and meaning of which has been forgotten—but is known to science
    either as olivine, on account of the olive-green colour sometimes
    characterizing it, or as chrysolite. It is of interest to note that the
    last word, derived from <span xml:lang="el">χρυσός</span>, golden, and <span xml:lang="el">λίθος</span>,
    stone, was in use at the time of Pliny, but was employed for topaz and
    other yellow stones, while his topaz, curiously enough, designated
    the modern peridot (cf. <a href="#Page_199">p. 199</a>), an inversion that has occurred in
    other words. The true olivine must not be confused with the jewellers’
    ‘olivine,’ which is a green garnet from the Ural Mountains (<a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>).
    Peridot is comparatively soft, the hardness varying from 6½ to 7 on
    Mohs’s scale, and is suitable only for articles which are not likely
    to be scratched; the polish of a peridot worn in a ring would soon
    deteriorate. The choicest stones are in colour a lovely bottle-green
    (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 2) of various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
    depths; the olive-green stones (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 3) cannot compare with their sisters in attractiveness. The
    step form of cutting is considered the best for peridot, but it is
    sometimes cut round or oval in shape, with brilliant-cut fronts.</p>

  <p>Peridot is a silicate of magnesium and iron, corresponding to the
    formula (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, ferrous iron, therefore, replacing
    magnesia. To the ferrous iron it is indebted for its colour, the
    pure magnesium silicate being almost colourless, and the olive tint
    arises from the oxidation of the iron. The latitude in the composition
    resulting from this replacement is evinced in the considerable range
    that has been observed in the physical characters, but the crystalline
    symmetry persists unaltered; the lower values correspond to the stones
    that are usually met with as gems. Peridot belongs to the orthorhombic
    system of crystalline symmetry, and the crystals, which display a
    large number of faces, are prismatic in form and generally somewhat
    flattened. The stones, however, that come into the market for cutting
    as gems are rarely unbroken. The dichroism is rather faint, one of the
    twin colours being slightly more yellowish than the other, but it is
    more pronounced in the olive-tinted stones. The values of the least
    and greatest of the principal indices of refraction vary greatly,
    from 1·650 and 1·683 to 1·668 and 1·701, but the double refraction,
    amounting to 0·033, remains unaffected. Peridot, though surpassed by
    sphene in extent of double refraction, easily excels all the ordinary
    gem-stones in this respect, and this character is readily recognizable
    in a cut stone by the apparent doubling of the opposite edges when
    viewed through the table facet (cf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>). An equally large
    variation occurs in the specific gravity, namely, from 3·3 to 3·5.</p>

  <p>Peridots of deep bottle-green hue command moderate prices at the

    tinted stones run down to a few shillings a carat. The rate per carat
    may be very much larger for stones of exceptional size and quality.</p>

  <p>Olivine, to use the ordinary mineralogical term, is a common and
    important constituent of certain kinds of igneous rocks, and it is
    also found in those strange bodies, meteorites, which come to us
    from outer cosmical space. Except in basaltic lavas, it occurs in
    grains and rarely in well-shaped crystals. Stones that are large and
    transparent enough for cutting purposes come almost entirely from the
    island Zebirget or St. John situated on the west coast of the Red Sea,
    opposite to the port of Berenice. This island belongs to the Khedive of
    Egypt, and is at present leased to a French syndicate. It is believed
    to be the same as the mysterious island which produced the ‘topaz’
    of Pliny’s time. Magnificent stones have been discovered here, rich
    green in colour, and 20 to 30, and occasionally as much as 80, carats
    in weight when cut; a rough mass attained to the large weight of 190
    carats. Pretty, light-green stones are supplied by Queensland, and
    peridots of a less pleasing dark-yellowish shade of green, and without
    any sign of crystal form, have during recent years come from North
    America. Stones rather similar to those from Queensland have latterly
    been found in the Bernardino Valley in Upper Burma, not far from the
    ruby mines.</p>

    <div class="subhead">(<i>Jargoon</i>, <i>Hyacinth</i>, <i>Jacinth</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ZIRCON, which, if known at all in jewellery, is called by its variety
    names, jargoon and hyacinth or jacinth, is a species that deserves
    greater recognition than it receives. The colourless stones rival
    even diamond in splendour of brilliance and display of ‘fire’; the
    leaf-green stones (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 13) possess a restful beauty
    that commends itself; the deep-red stones (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 14), if
    somewhat sombre, have a certain grandeur; and no other species produces
    such magnificent stones of golden-yellow hue (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 12).
    Zircon is well known in Ceylon, which supplies the world with the
    finest specimens, and is highly appreciated by the inhabitants of that
    sunny isle, but it scarcely finds a place in jewellery elsewhere. The
    colourless stones are cut as brilliants, but brilliant-cut fronts with
    step-cut backs is the usual style adopted for the coloured stones.</p>

  <p>Zircon is a silicate of zirconium corresponding to the formula
    ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, but uranium and the rare earths are generally present in
    small quantities. The aurora-red variety is known as hyacinth or
    jacinth, and the term jargoon is applied to the other transparent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
    varieties, and especially to the yellow stones. The most attractive
    colours shown by zircon are leaf-green, golden-yellow, and deep red.
    Other common colours are brown, greenish, and sky-blue. Colourless
    stones are not found in nature, but result from the application of heat
    to the yellow and brown stones.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is ancient, and comes from the Arabic
    <i xml:lang="ar">zarqūn</i>, vermilion, or the Persian <i xml:lang="fa">zarqūn</i>, gold-coloured. From
    the same source in all probability is derived the word jargoon through
    the French <i xml:lang="fr">jargon</i> and the Italian <i xml:lang="it">giacone</i>. Hyacinth (cf. <a href="#Page_211">p. 211</a>) is
    transliterated from the Greek <span xml:lang="el">ὑάκινθος</span>, itself adapted from
    an old Indian word; it is in no way connected with the flower of the
    same name. The last word has seen some changes of meaning. In Pliny’s
    time yellow zircons were indiscriminately classified with other yellow
    stones as chrysolite. His hyacinth was used for the sapphire of the
    present day, but was subsequently applied to any transparent corundum.
    Upon the introduction of the terms, sapphire and ruby, for the blue and
    the red corundum hyacinth became restricted to the other varieties, of
    which the yellow was the commonest. In the darkness of the Middle Ages
    it was loosely employed for all yellow stones emanating from India,
    and was finally, with increasing discernment in the characters of
    gem-stones, assigned to the yellow zircon, since it was the commonest
    yellow stone from India.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>—Zircon<br />Crystal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Considered from the scientific point of view, zircon is by far the most
    interesting and the most remarkable of the gem-stones. The problem
    presented by its characters and constitution is one that still awaits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
    a satisfactory solution. Certain zircons, which are found as rolled
    pebbles in Ceylon and never show any trace of crystalline faces, have
    very nearly single refraction, and the values of the refractive index
    vary from 1·790 to 1·840, and the specific gravity is about 4·00 to
    4·14, and the hardness is slightly greater than that of quartz, being
    about 7¼. On the other hand, such stones as the red zircons from
    Expailly have remarkably different properties. They show crystalline
    faces with tetragonal symmetry, the faces present being four prismatic
    faces mutually intersecting at right angles and four inclined faces at
    each end (Fig. 78). They have large double refraction, varying from
    0·044 to 0·062, which is readily discerned in a cut stone (cf. <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>),
    and the refractive indices are high, the ordinary index varying
    from 1·923 to 1·931 and the extraordinary from 1·967 to 1·993. Since
    the ordinary is less than the extraordinary index the sign of the
    double refraction is positive. The specific gravity likewise is much
    higher, varying from 4·67 to 4·71. The second type, therefore, sinks
    in molten silver-thallium nitrate, whereas the first type floats. The
    second type is also slightly harder, being about 7½ on Mohs’s scale.
    By heating either of these types the physical characters are not much
    altered, except that the colour is weakened or entirely driven off and
    some change takes place in the double refraction. But between these
    two types may be found zircons upon which the effect of heating is
    striking. They seem to contract in size so that the specific gravity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
    increases as much as three units in the first place of decimals, and a
    corresponding increase takes place in the refractive indices, and in
    the amount of double refraction. The cause of these changes remains a
    matter of speculation. Evidently a third type of zircon exists which
    is capable of most intimate association with either of the other
    types, and which is very susceptible to the effect of heat. It may be
    noted that stones of the intermediate type are usually characterized
    by a banded or zonal structure suggesting a want of homogeneity. The
    theory has been advanced that zircon contains an unknown element which
    has not yet been separated from zirconium. Zircon of the first type
    favours green, sky-blue, and golden-yellow colours; honey-yellow, light
    green, blue, and red colours characterize the second type; and the
    intermediate stones are mostly yellowish green, cloudy blue, and green.</p>

  <p>It is another peculiarity of zircon that it sometimes shows in the
    spectroscope absorption bands (<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>), which were observed in 1866 by
    Church. Many zircons do not exhibit the bands at all, and others only
    display the two prominent bands in the red end of the spectrum.</p>

  <p>Of all the gem-stones zircon alone approaches diamond in brilliance of
    lustre, and it also possesses considerable ‘fire’; it can, of course,
    be readily distinguished by its inferior hardness, but a judgment based
    merely on inspection by eye might easily be erroneous.</p>

  <p>According to Church, who has made a lifelong study of zircon, the green
    and yellowish stones of the first variety emit a brilliant orange light
    when being ground on a copper wheel charged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span> diamond dust, and
    the golden stones of the intermediate type glow with a fine orange
    incandescence in the flame of a bunsen burner; the latter phenomenon is
    supposed to be due to the presence of thoria.</p>

  <p>The leaf-green stones almost invariably show a series of parallel bands
    in the interior.</p>

  <p>Zircons vary from 5s. to 15s. a carat, but exceptional stones may be
    worth more.</p>

  <p>By far the finest stones come from Ceylon. The colourless stones are
    there known as ‘Matura diamonds,’ and the hyacinth includes garnet
    (hessonite) of similar colour, which is found with it in the same
    gravels. The stones are always water-worn. Small hyacinths and deep-red
    stones come from Expailly, Auvergne, France, and yellowish-red crystals
    are found in the Ilmen Mountains, Orenburg, Russia. Remarkably fine
    red stones have been discovered at Mudgee, New South Wales, and
    yellowish-brown stones accompany diamond at the Kimberley mines, South
    Africa.</p>

    <div class="subhead">(<i>Chrysolite</i>, <i>Cat’s-Eye</i>, <i>Cymophane</i>, <i>Alexandrite</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">CHRYSOBERYL has at times enjoyed fleeting popularity on account of the
    excellent cat’s-eyes cut from the fibrous stones, and in the form of
    alexandrite it meets with a steadier, if still limited, demand. It is a
    gem-stone that is seldom met with in ordinary jewellery, although its
    considerable hardness befits it for all such purposes.</p>

  <p>Chrysoberyl is in composition an aluminate of beryllium corresponding
    to the formula BeAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and is therefore closely akin to spinel.
    It usually contains some ferric and chromic oxides in place of alumina,
    and ferrous oxide in place of beryllia, and it is to these accessory
    constituents that its tints are due. Other gem-stones containing the
    uncommon element beryllium are phenakite and beryl. Pale yellowish
    green, the commonest colour, is supposed to be caused by ferrous
    oxide; such stones are known to jewellers as chrysolite (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>,
    Fig. 12). Cat’s-eyes (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 1) have often also a brownish
    shade of green. The bluish green and dark olive-green stones known
    as alexandrite (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Figs. 11, 13) differ in appearance so
    markedly from their fairer sisters that their common parentage seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
    almost incredible. The dull fires that glow within them, and the
    curious change that comes over them at night, add a touch of mystery to
    these dark stones. Chromic oxide is held responsible for their colour.
    The cat’s-eyes are, of course, always cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, but otherwise
    chrysoberyl is faceted.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is composed of two Greek words, <span xml:lang="el">χρυσός</span>,
    golden, and <span xml:lang="el">βήρυλλος</span>, beryl, and etymologically more
    correctly defines the lighter-coloured stones, which were, indeed, at
    one time the only kind known. Chrysolite from <span xml:lang="el">χρυσὁς</span>, golden,
    and <span xml:lang="el">λίθος</span>, stone, has much the same significance. This name
    is preferred by jewellers, but in science it is applied to an entirely
    different species, which is known in jewellery as peridot. Cymophane,
    from <span xml:lang="el">κῦμα</span>, wave, and <span xml:lang="el">φαίνειν</span>, appear, refers to the
    peculiar opalescence characteristic of cat’s-eyes; it is sometimes
    used to designate these stones, but does not find a place within
    the vocabulary of jewellery. Alexandrite is named after Alexander
    <span class="smcap">II</span>, Czar of Russia, because it first came to light on his
    birthday. That circumstance, coupled with its display of the national
    colours, green and red, and its at one time restriction to the mining
    district near Ekaterinburg, renders it dear to the heart of all loyal
    Russians.</p>

  <p>Chrysoberyl crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, and occurs in
    rather dull, complex crystals, which are sometimes so remarkably
    twinned, especially in the variety called alexandrite, as to simulate
    hexagonal crystals. In keeping with the crystalline symmetry it
    is doubly refractive and biaxial, having two directions of single
    refraction. The least and the greatest of the principal indices of
    refraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> may have any values between 1·742 and 1·749, and 1·750 and
    1·757, respectively, the maximum amount of double refraction remaining
    always the same, namely, 0·009. The mean principal refractive index
    is close to the least; the sign of the double refraction is therefore
    positive, and the shadow-edge corresponding to the lower index, as
    seen in the refractometer, has little, if any, perceptible motion
    when the stone is rotated. The converse is the case with corundum;
    the sign is negative, and it is the shadow-edge corresponding to the
    greater refractive index that remains unaltered in position on rotation
    of the stone. This test would suffice to separate chrysoberyl from
    yellow corundum, even if the refractive indices of the former were
    not sensibly lower than those of the latter. Also, the dichroism of
    chrysolite is stronger than that of yellow sapphires. In alexandrite
    this phenomenon is most prominent; the absorptive tints, columbine-red,
    orange, and emerald-green, corresponding to the three principal
    optical directions, are in striking contrast, and the first differs
    so much from the intrinsic colour of the stone as to be obvious to
    the unaided eye, and is the cause of the red tints visible in a cut
    stone. The curious change in colour of alexandrite, from leaf-green to
    raspberry-red, that takes place when the stone is seen by artificial
    light, is due to a different cause, as has been pointed out above (<a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>).
    The effect is illustrated by Figs. 11, 13 on <a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, which
    represent a fine Ceylon stone as seen by daylight and artificial light;
    the influence of dichroism may be noticed in the former picture. The
    specific gravity of chrysoberyl varies from 3·68 to 3·78. In hardness
    this species ranks above spinel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span> and comes next to corundum, being
    given the symbol 8½ on Mohs’s scale. Certain stones contain a multitude
    of microscopic channels arranged in parallel position. When the stones
    are cut with their rounded surface parallel to the channels, a broadish
    band of light is visible running across the stone at right angles
    to them, and suggests the pupil of a cat’s eye, whence the common
    name for the stones. The fact that the channels are hollow causes an
    opalescence, which is absent from the quartz cat’s-eye.</p>

  <p>The most important locality for the yellowish chrysoberyl is the rich
    district of Minas Novas, Minas Geraes, Brazil, where it occurs in the
    form of pebbles, and excellent material is also supplied by Ceylon,
    in both crystals and rounded pebbles. Other places for chrysolite are
    Haddam, Connecticut, and Greenfield, Saratoga County, New York, in
    the United States, and recently in the gem-gravels near the Somabula
    Forest, Rhodesia. Ceylon supplies some of the best cat’s-eyes.
    Alexandrite was first discovered, as already stated, at the emerald
    mines near Ekaterinburg, in the Urals; but the supply is now nearly
    exhausted. A poorer quality comes from Takowaja, also in the Urals.
    Good alexandrite has come to light in Ceylon, and most of the stones
    that are placed on the market at the present day have emanated from
    that island. The Ceylon stones reach a considerable size, often as much
    as from 10 to 20 carats in weight; the Russian stones have a better
    colour and are more beautiful, but they are less transparent, and
    rarely exceed a carat in weight. Good chrysolite may be worth from 10s.
    to £2 a carat, and cat’s-eye runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span> from £1 to £4 a carat, depending
    upon the quality. Alexandrites meet with a steady demand in Russia, and
    fine stones are scarce; flawless stones about a carat in weight are
    worth as much as £30 a carat, and even quite ordinary stones fetch £4 a
    carat.</p>

  <p>From Ceylon, that interesting home of gems, have originated some
    magnificent chrysoberyls, including a superb chrysolite, 80¾ carats
    in weight, and another, a splendid brownish yellow in colour and
    very even in tint, and two large alexandrites, green in daylight and
    a rich red by night, weighing 63⅜ and 28<span class="fraction"><sup>23</sup>/<sub>32</sub></span> carats. The finest
    cut chrysolite existing is probably the one exhibited in the Mineral
    Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History). Absolutely flawless
    and weighing 43¾ carats, it was formerly contained in the famous Hope
    collection, and is described on page 56 and figured on <a href="#Plate_XXI">Plate XXI</a> of
    the catalogue prepared by B. Hertz, which was published in 1839; the
    weight there given includes the brilliants and the ring in which it
    was mounted. It is shown, about actual size, in <a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 12.
    A magnificent cat’s-eye, 35·5 by 35 mm. in size, which also formed
    part of the Hope collection, was included in the crown jewels taken
    from the King of Kandy in 1815. The crystalline markings in the cut
    stone are so arranged that the lower half shows an altar overhung by a
    torch. The stone has been famous in Ceylon for many ages. It was set
    in gold with rubies cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>. Two fine Ceylon alexandrites of
    exceptional merit, weighing 42 and 26¾ carats, are also exhibited in
    the Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History). The former
    is illustrated in <a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Figs. 11, 13, as seen in daylight and in
    artificial light.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH the commonest and, in its natural form, the most easily
    recognizable of mineral substances, quartz nevertheless holds a not
    inconspicuous position among gem-stones, because, as amethyst (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate
    XXVII</a>, Fig. 7), it provides stones of the finest violet colour;
    moreover, the yellow quartz (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 5) so ably vies with the
    true topaz that it is universally known to jewellers by the name of the
    latter species, and is too often confounded with it, and the lustrous,
    limpid rock-crystal even aspires to the local title of ‘diamond.’
    For all purposes where a violet or yellow stone is required, quartz
    is admirably suited; it is hard and durable, and it has the merit,
    or possibly to some minds the drawback, of being moderate in price.
    Despite its comparative lack of ‘fire,’ rock-crystal might replace
    paste in rings and buckles with considerable advantage from the point
    of view of durability. The chatoyant quartz, especially in the form
    known as tiger’s-eye, will for beauty bear comparison with the true
    cat’s-eye, which is a variety of chrysoberyl. Except that cat’s-eye is
    cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, quartz is step- or sometimes brilliant-cut.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

  <p>Ranking with corundum next to diamond as the simplest in composition
    of the gem-stones, quartz is the crystallized form of silica, oxide
    of silicon, corresponding to the formula SiO<sub>2</sub>. When pure, it
    is entirely devoid of the faintest trace of colour and absolutely
    water-clear. Such stones are called rock-crystal, and it is easy to
    understand why in early days it was supposed to represent a form
    of petrified water. It is these brilliant, transparent stones that
    are, when small, known in many localities as ‘diamonds.’ Before
    the manufacture of glass was discovered and brought to perfection,
    rock-crystal was in considerable use for fashioning into cups, vases,
    and so forth. The beautiful tints characterizing quartz are due to the
    usual metallic oxides. To manganese is given the credit of the superb
    purple or violet colour of amethyst, which varies considerably in
    depth. Jewellers are inclined to distinguish the deep-coloured stones
    with the prefix ‘oriental,’ but the practice is to be deprecated, since
    it might lead to confusion with the true oriental amethyst, which is
    a purple sapphire, one of the rarest varieties of corundum. Quartz
    of a yellow hue is properly called citrine, but, as already stated,
    jewellers habitually prefer the name ‘topaz’ for it, and distinguish
    the true topaz by the prefix Brazilian—not a very happy term, since
    both the yellow topaz and the yellow quartz occur plentifully in
    Brazil. Sometimes the yellow quartz is termed occidental, Spanish,
    or false topaz. Stones with a brownish or smoky tinge of yellow are
    called cairngorm, or Scotch topaz. The colour of the yellow stones
    is doubtless due to a trace of ferric oxide. Stones of a smoky brown
    colour are known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span> as smoky-quartz. Rose-quartz, which is rose-red or
    pink in colour and hazy in texture, is comparatively rare; strange
    to say, it has never been found in distinct crystals. The tint,
    which may be due to titanium, is fugitive, and fades on exposure to
    strong sunlight. In milky quartz, as the name suggests, the interior
    is so hazy as to impart to the stone a milky appearance. It has
    frequently happened that quartz has crystallized after the formation
    of other minerals, with the result that the latter are found inside
    it. Prase, or mother-of-emerald, which at one time was supposed to
    be the mother-rock of emerald, is a quartz coloured leek-green by
    actinolite fibres in the interior. Specimens containing hair-like
    fibres of rutile—the so-called <i xml:lang="fr">flêches d’amour</i>—are common in mineral
    collections, and are sometimes to be seen worked. When enclosing a
    massive, light-coloured, fibrous mineral, the stones have a chatoyant
    effect, and display, when suitably cut, a fine cat’s-eye effect; in
    tiger’s-eye the enclosed mineral is crocidolite, an asbestos, the
    original blue hue of which has been changed to a fine golden-brown
    by oxidation. Quartz which contains scales of mica, hematite, or
    other flaky mineral has a vivid spangled appearance, and is known
    as aventurine; it has occasionally been employed for brooches or
    similar articles of jewellery. Rainbow-quartz, or iris, is a quartz
    which contains cracks, the chromatic effect being the result of the
    interference of light reflected from them; it has been artificially
    produced by heating the stone and suddenly cooling it.</p>

  <p>The name of the species is an old German mining term of unknown meaning
    which has been in general use in all languages since the sixteenth
    century.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span> Amethyst is derived from
    <span xml:lang="el">ἀμέθυστος</span>, not drunken,
    possibly from a foolish notion that the wearer was exempt from the
    usual consequences of unrestrained libations. Pliny suggests as an
    alternative explanation that its colour approximates to, but does not
    quite reach, that of wine. Aventurine, from <i xml:lang="la">aventura</i>, an accident,
    was first applied to glass spangled with copper, the effect being
    said to have been accidentally discovered owing to a number of copper
    filings falling into a pot of molten glass in a Venetian factory.</p>

    <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span>—Quartz<br />Crystal.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Quartz belongs to the hexagonal system of crystalline symmetry,
    and crystallizes in the familiar six-sided prisms terminated by
    six inclined, often triangular, faces (Fig. 79); twins are common,
    though they are not always obvious from the outward development. In
    accordance with the symmetry the refraction is double, and there is one
    direction of single refraction, namely, that parallel to the edge of
    the prism. The ordinary refractive index has the value 1·544, and the
    extraordinary 1·553, and since the latter is the greater, the sign of
    the double refraction is positive. The double refraction is small in
    amount, but is large enough to enable the apparent doubling of certain
    of the opposite edges of a faceted stone to be perceptible when viewed
    with a lens through the table-facet. The dichroism of the deep-coloured
    stones is quite distinct. Quartz has only about the same amount of
    colour dispersion as ordinary glass, and lacks, therefore, ‘fire.’
    The application of strong heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> tends, as usual, to weaken or drive
    off the colour. Thus the dense smoky-quartz found in Spain, Brazil,
    and elsewhere is converted into stones of a colour varying from light
    yellow to reddish brown according to the amount and duration of the
    application. In the case of amethyst the colour is changed to a deep
    orange, or entirely driven off if the temperature be high enough. Its
    density is very constant, varying only from 2·654 to 2·660; the purest
    stones are the lightest. To it has been assigned the symbol 7 on Mohs’s
    scale of hardness.</p>

  <p>To physicists quartz is one of the most interesting of minerals because
    of its power of rotating, to an extent depending upon the thickness of
    the section, the plane of polarization of a beam of light traversing it
    in a direction parallel to the prism edge. It appears, moreover, from
    a study of the pyro-electric and general physical characters, that its
    molecular structure has a helical arrangement, which, like all screws,
    may have a right- or left-handed character. Amethyst is, in fact,
    invariably composed of separate twin individuals, alternately right-
    and left-handed; in some remarkable crystals the section at right
    angles to the prism edge is composed of triangular sectors, alternately
    of different hands and of different tints—purple and white. To the
    twinning is due the rippled fracture and the feathery inclusions so
    characteristic of amethyst.</p>

  <p>Besides its use for ornamental purposes, quartz finds a place as the
    material for lenses intended for delicate photographic work, because
    its transparency to the ultra-violet light is so much greater than
    that of glass. Spectacle lenses made of it are in demand, because they
    are not liable to scratches, and retain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span> therefore, their polish
    indefinitely. When fused in the oxyhydrogen flame, quartz becomes a
    silica glass, of specific gravity 2·2 and hardness 5 on Mohs’s scale,
    which has proved of great service for laboratory ware, because it
    withstands sudden and unequal heating without any danger of fracture;
    it has also in fine threads been invaluable for delicate torsion work,
    because it acquires not the smallest amount of permanent twist, in this
    respect being superior to the finest silk threads.</p>

  <p>Clear rock-crystal fetches little more than the cost of the cutting;
    citrine and amethyst are worth from 1s. to 5s. a carat, depending
    upon the quality and size of the stone; smoky-quartz is practically
    valueless; rose-quartz realizes less than 1s. a carat; and the value
    of cat’s-eye is also small—only 1s. to 2s. 6d. a carat. Tiger’s-eye at
    one time commanded as much as 25s. a carat, but the supply exceeded the
    demand, with the consequent collapse in the price.</p>

  <p>Beautiful, brilliant, and limpid rock-crystal is found in various parts
    of the world: in the Swiss Alps, at Bourg d’Oisans in the Dauphiné
    Alps, France, in the famous Carrara marble, in the Marmaros Comitat
    of Hungary, and in the United States, Brazil, Madagascar, and Japan.
    Small lustrous stones, known in their localities as ‘Isle of Wight,’
    ‘Cornish,’ or ‘Bristol diamonds,’ are found in our own country. Brazil
    supplies stones out of which have been cut the clear balls used in
    crystal-gazing. The finest amethysts come from Brazil—especially the
    State of Rio Grande do Sul—and from Uruguay, India, and the gem-gravels
    of Ceylon; good stones also occur at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span> Ekaterinburg, in the Ural
    Mountains. A splendid Brazilian amethyst, weighing 334 carats, and
    two Russian stones—one hexagonal in contour, weighing 88 carats, and
    the other, a deep purple in colour with a circular table, weighing 73
    carats—are exhibited in the British Museum (Natural History). Cairngorm
    is known from the place of that name in Banffshire, Scotland, whence
    fine specimens have emanated; it is a gem much valued in that country.
    Fine cairngorm has also originated from Pike’s Peak, Colorado. Splendid
    yellow stones have had their birth in the States of Minas Geraes, São
    Paulo, and Goyãz, of Brazil—especially in the last. The fine Spanish
    smoky-quartz, which, as already stated, turns yellow on heating, comes
    from Hinojosa, in the Province of Cordova. The delicate rose-quartz
    is known at Bodenmais in Bavaria, Paris in Maine, United States, and
    Ekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains. The finest cat’s-eyes are found in
    India and Ceylon, and are high in favour with the natives. Greenish
    stones of an inferior quality are brought from the Fichtelgebirge in
    Bavaria, and are sold as ‘Hungarian cat’s-eyes,’ despite the fact
    that no such stone occurs in Hungary—another instance of jewellers’
    disdain for accuracy. Tiger’s-eye occurs in considerable quantity in
    the neighbourhood of Griquatown, Griqualand West, South Africa. A
    silicified crocidolite, in which the blue colour is retained, comes
    also from Salzburg, and is known as sapphire- or azure-quartz, or
    siderite.</p>

  <p>Certain of the pebbles found on the seashore of our coasts, especially
    off the Isle of Wight and North Wales, cut into attractive, clear
    stones, more or less yellow in colour; but examples suitable for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span> the
    purpose are not so numerous as might be supposed, and do not reward any
    casual search. <i xml:lang="fr">Les affaires sont les affaires.</i> The local lapidary,
    instead of explaining that the pebbles brought to him are not worth
    cutting, finds it more convenient and profitable to substitute for
    them other, inferior and badly cut, stones, bought by the gross, or
    even paste stones; the customer, on the other hand, is contented with
    a pretty bauble, and is not grateful for the information that it might
    have been obtained for a fraction of the sum paid.</p>

    <div class="headingc">CHALCEDONY, AGATE, ETC.</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">CHALCEDONY and agate, and their endless varieties, are composed
    mainly of silica, but the separate individual crystals are so small
    as to be invisible to the unaided eyesight, and occasionally are
    so extremely minute that the structure is almost amorphous. The
    colour and appearance vary greatly, depending upon the impurities
    contained in the stone, and, since both have been made a criterion for
    differentiation of types, a host of names have come into use, none of
    which are susceptible of strict definition. On the whole, these stones
    may be divided into two groups: chalcedony, in which the structure is
    concretionary and the colour comparatively uniform, and agate, in which
    the arrangement takes the form of bands, varying greatly in tint and
    colour.</p>

  <p>The refraction, though double in the individual, is irregular over the
    stone as a whole, and the indices approximate to 1·550. The specific
    gravity ranges from 2·62 to 2·64, depending upon the impurities
    present. The degree of hardness is about the same as that of quartz,
    namely, 7 on Mohs’s scale. All kinds are more or less porous, and
    stones of a dull colour are therefore artificially tinted after being
    worked.</p>

  <p>The term chalcedony, derived from <span xml:lang="el">χαλκηδών</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span> the name of a
    town in Asia Minor, is usually confined to stones of a greyish tinge.
    Stones artificially coloured an emerald green have been cut and put
    upon the market as ‘emeraldine.’ Carnelian is a clear red chalcedony,
    and sard is somewhat similar, but brownish in tint. Chrysoprase is
    apple-green in colour, nickel oxide being supposed to be the agent.
    Prase (cf. <a href="#Page_240">p. 240</a>), which is a dull leek-green in hue, may also in part
    be referred here; the name comes from <span xml:lang="el">πράσμον</span>, a leek. Plasma,
    which may have the same derivation, is a brighter leek-green. Jasper
    is a chalcedony coloured blood-red by iron oxide, while bloodstone is
    a green chalcedony spotted with jasper; they are popular stones for
    signet rings. Flint, an opaque chalcedony, breaks with a sharp cutting
    edge, and was much in request with early man as a tool or a weapon; its
    property of giving sparks when struck with steel rendered it invaluable
    before the invention of matches. Hornstone is somewhat similar, but
    more brittle, while chert is a flinty rock.</p>

  <p>Agate, named after the river Achates in Sicily, where it was found at
    the time of Theophrastus, has a peculiar banded structure, the bands
    being usually irregular in shape, following the configuration of the
    cavity in which it was formed. Moss-agate, or mocha-stone, contains
    moss-like inclusions of some fibrous mineral. Onyx is an agate with
    regular bands, the layers having sharply different colours; when black
    and white, it has, in days gone by, been employed for cameos. Sardonyx
    is similar in structure, but red and white in colour. Agate is used in
    delicate balances for supporting the steel knife-edges of the balance
    itself and of the panholders, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>and is largely employed—especially when
    artificially coloured—for umbrella handles and similar articles.</p>

  <p>Chalcedony and agate are found the whole world over, but India, and
    particularly Brazil, are noted for their fine carnelians and agates.</p>

    <div class="headingc">OPAL</div>
    <div class="subhead">(<i>White Opal</i>, <i>Black Opal</i>, <i>Fire-Opal</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THAT opal in early times excited keen admiration is evident from
    Pliny’s enthusiastic description of these stones: “For in them you
    shall see the burning fire of the carbuncle, the glorious purple of the
    amethyst, the green sea of the emerald, all glittering together in an
    incredible mixture of light.” During much of last century, owing to the
    foolish superstition that ill-luck dogs the footsteps of the wearer,
    the species lay under a cloud, which has even now not quite dispersed,
    but exercises a prejudicial effect upon the fortunes of the stone. It
    has, however, recently attracted considerable attention owing to the
    discovery of the splendid black opals in Australia; at one moment black
    with the darkness of night, at the next by a chance movement glowing
    with vivid crimson flame, such stones may justly be considered the most
    remarkable in modern jewellery. At the present day opal is divided by
    jewellers roughly into two main groups: ‘white’ (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 6)
    and ‘black’ (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 9), according as the tint is light or
    dark, fire-opal (<a href="#Plate_XXVII">Plate XXVII</a>, Fig. 10) standing in a separate category.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

  <p>Opal differs from the rest of the principal gem-stones in being
    not a crystalline body, but a solidified jelly, and it depends for
    its attractiveness upon the characteristic play of colour, known,
    in consequence, as opalescence (cf. <a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>), which arises from a
    peculiarity in the structure. Opal is mainly silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, in
    composition, but contains in addition an amount of water varying in
    precious opal from 6 to 10 per cent. As the original jelly cooled, it
    became riddled throughout with cracks, which were afterwards generally
    filled with opal matter, containing a different amount of water,
    and therefore differing slightly in refractivity from the original
    substance. The structure not being quite homogeneous, each crack has
    the same action upon light as a soap-film, and gives rise to precisely
    similar phenomena; the thinner and more uniform the cracks, the
    greater the splendour of the chromatic display, the particular tint
    depending upon the direction in which the stone is viewed. The cracks
    in certain opals were not filled up, and therefore contain air. Such
    stones appear opaque and devoid of opalescence until plunged into
    water; they are consequently known as hydrophane, from <span xml:lang="el">ὕδωρ</span>,
    water, and <span xml:lang="el">φαίνεσθαι</span>, to make appear. Owing to the effect of
    total-reflection, light was stopped on the hither side of the cracks
    before they were filled with water, which is not far inferior to opal
    in refractivity; it is surprising how much water these stones will
    absorb.</p>

  <p>Opal is colourless when pure, but is nearly always more or less milky
    and opaque, or tinted various dull shades by ferric oxide, magnesia
    or, alumina. The so-called black opal is generally a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span> dark grey or
    blue, and very rarely quite black. That the coloration is not due
    to ordinary absorption, but to the action of cracks in the stone,
    is shown by the fact that the transmitted light is complementary to
    the reflected light; the blue opal is, for instance, a yellow when
    held up so that light has passed through it. In many black opals the
    opalescent material occurs in far too tiny pieces to be cut separately,
    and the whole iron-stained matrix is cut and polished and sold under
    the name ‘opal-matrix.’ The reddish and orange-coloured stones known
    as fire-opal have pronounced colour and only slight milkiness; they
    display the customary opalescence in certain directions. These stones
    are often faceted, but otherwise opals are cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>, either
    flat or steep—generally the former in brooches and pendants, and the
    latter in rings. Opal is somewhat soft, varying from 5 to 6½ on Mohs’s
    scale, and is therefore easily scratched. The specific gravity ranges
    from 2·10 to 2·20, and the refractive index from 1·444 to 1·464, the
    refraction, of course, being always single. It is unwise to immerse
    opals in liquids on account of their porosity.</p>

  <p>The name opal comes to us through the Latin <i xml:lang="la">opallus</i>, which was used
    for the same species as understood by the term at the present day, but
    the word has a far older origin, which has not been traced. The Romans
    also called the mineral <i xml:lang="la">pæderos</i>, the Greek form of Cupid, a name
    applied to all rosy stones. The name cacholong, for the bluish-white
    porcelain variety, which is very porous and adheres to the tongue, is
    of Tartar origin; the stone is highly valued in the East.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span></p>

  <p>The oldest mines, which up to quite a recent date were the only
    extensive deposit of opal known, were at Cserwenitsa, near Kashau,
    in Hungary. From them in all probability emanated the opals known to
    the Romans. The opals from this locality were generally quite small,
    and large pieces were rare and commanded high prices. The Hungary
    mines, however, proved quite unable to compete with the rich fields
    at White Cliffs, New South Wales, in spite of the efforts that were
    made to depreciate and exclude from the market the new stones, and at
    the present time few of the opals on the market come from them. As so
    often happens, the White Cliffs deposit was discovered by accident.
    In 1889 a hunter, when tracking a wounded kangaroo, chanced to pick
    up an attractively coloured opal. The district is so waterless and
    forbidding that, but for such a chance, the opals might have long lain
    hidden. They occur in seams in deposits of Cretaceous Age in a variety
    of ways, filling cavities in rocks or sandstones, or cracks in wood, or
    replacing wood, saurian bones, and some spiky mineral, which may have
    been glauberite. In recent years, another rich deposit was discovered
    farther north, on both sides of the boundary between Queensland and
    New South Wales. The field is remarkable for the darkness of its
    opals, which are called ‘black opal’ in contradistinction to the
    lighter-coloured stones previously known. From Lightning Ridge in
    New South Wales come stones stained deep black which quite merit the
    designation black opal. The sandstone in which they are found is
    rich in iron, and this is no doubt responsible for the deepness of
    their tint. Mexico is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span> noted for the fire-opal, which is found at
    Esperanza, Queretaro, and Zimapan; but other kinds of opal also are
    found at these places.</p>

  <p>The price of opal varies greatly, according to the intrinsic colour
    and the uniformity and brilliance of the opalescence. Common opal can
    be bought at as low a rate as 1s. a carat, while black opal ranges
    from 10s. to £8 a carat; but a good dark stone displaying a flaming
    opalescence commands a fancy figure, fine stones of this class being
    exceedingly rare. Fire-opal enjoys only a limited popularity now,
    though a few years ago it was in some demand; the price runs from 2s.
    to 10s. a carat.</p>

    <div class="subhead">(<i>Moonstone, Sunstone, Labradorite, Amazon-Stone</i>)</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THOUGH second to none among minerals in scientific interest, whether
    regarded from the point of view of their crystalline characters or
    the important part they play in the formation of rocks, the group
    included under the general name felspar occupies but a humble place
    in jewellery. It consists of three distinct species, orthoclase,
    albite, and anorthite, which are silicates of aluminium, and potassium,
    sodium, or calcium, corresponding to the formulae KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,
    NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> respectively, and also of
    species intermediate in composition between albite and orthoclase, or
    albite and anorthite. While differing in crystalline symmetry, all
    are characterized by two directions of cleavage which are nearly at
    right angles to one another. The double refraction, which is slight in
    amount, is biaxial in character and variable in sign. The values of the
    least and greatest of the indices of refraction range between 1·52 and
    1·53, and 1·53 and 1·55 respectively, the double refraction at the same
    time varying from 0·007 to 0·012. The specific gravity lies between
    2·48 and 2·66, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span> the hardness ranges between the degrees 6 and 7 on
    Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p>Moonstone (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 4), which is mainly pure orthoclase, alone
    is at all common in jewellery. It forms such an admirable contrasting
    frame for large coloured stones that it deserves greater popularity;
    no doubt the cheapness of the stones militates against their proper
    appreciation. The milky, bluish opalescence from which they take their
    name is caused by the reflection of light at the thin twin-lamellæ
    of which the structure is composed. They are always cut more or less
    steeply <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>. The finest stones were at one time cut from
    the felspar that came from the St. Gothard district in Switzerland
    and was in consequence known as adularia from the neighbouring Adular
    Mountains, somewhat incorrectly, since none occurs at the latter
    locality. At the present day practically all the moonstones on the
    market come from Ceylon. They run in price from £3 to £20 per oz. (28
    grams).</p>

  <p>Sunstone is a felspar containing flakes of hematite or goethite which
    impart a spangled bronze appearance to the stones. Good material occurs
    in parts of Norway. The remarkable sheen of labradorite or blue felspar
    has its origin in the interference of light at lamellar surfaces in
    the interior; the uniformity of the colour over comparatively large
    areas testifies to the regularity of the lamellar arrangement. The
    finest specimens were brought from the Isle of St. Paul off the coast
    of Labrador, where they were first discovered in 1770; large masses
    also occur on the coast itself. Amazon-stone is an opaque green felspar
    which occurs in the Ilmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> Mountains, Orenburg, Russia, and at Pike’s
    Peak, Colorado, United States. It obtains its name from the Amazon
    River, where, however, none has ever been found; there may have been
    some confusion with a jade or similar stone.</p>

  <p>Occasionally clear colourless felspar has been faceted, and then
    closely resembles rock-crystal. A careful determination of the
    refractive indices and the specific gravity serves to discriminate
    between them.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">OF all the opaque stones turquoise (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 17) alone finds a
    prominent place in jewellery and can aspire to rank with the precious
    stones. The colour varies from a sky-blue or a greenish blue to a
    yellowish green or apple-green. Only the former tints, which are at
    the same time the rarer, are in general demand, and they possess the
    great advantage of harmonizing with the tint of the gold setting.
    The blue colours are, especially in the case of the Siberian stones,
    by no means permanent, and fade in course of time. Turquoise is
    amorphous and seldom crystalline, and is therefore somewhat porous; it
    should consequently never be immersed in liquids or be contaminated
    with greasy and dirty matter lest the dreaded change of colour be
    brought about. The stones are translucent in thin sections, and a
    good observation is possible with the refractometer if the back of
    the stone is flat and polished, since only the section immediately
    adjacent to the instrument is concerned; the refractive index is about
    1·61. The specific gravity varies from 2·75 to 2·89. Turquoise has a
    hardness of slightly under 6 on Mohs’s scale, and takes a good polish,
    which is fairly durable, since on account of the comparative opacity
    of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span> stones scratches on the surface are not very noticeable.
    In composition it is a complex phosphate of aluminium and copper,
    corresponding to the formula CuOH.[6Al(OH)<sub>2</sub>].H<sub>5</sub>.(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,
    with ferric oxide replacing some alumina. The blue colour is due to
    the copper constituent, and the predominance of iron may cause the
    greenish shades; but the water contained in the stones plays no mean
    part, since they turn a dirty green when it is driven off. The faded
    colour can sometimes be restored by immersion of the stone in ammonia
    and subsequent application of grease, but the effect is not lasting.
    Attempts are sometimes made to improve inferior stones by impregnating
    them with Berlin blue, but with only qualified success. Turquoises are
    said to be affected by the perspiration from the skin.</p>

  <p>The name of the species comes from a French word meaning Turkish, and
    arises from the fact that the gem-stone first reached Europe by way of
    Turkey. Another, but less obvious, suggestion is that it is derived
    from the Persian name for the species, <i xml:lang="fa">piruzeh</i>. Our turquoise and
    other phosphates of similar appearance were probably known to Pliny
    under the three names <i xml:lang="la">callais</i>, <i xml:lang="la">callaina</i>, and <i xml:lang="la">callaica</i>.</p>

  <p>The finest turquoise still comes from the famous mines near Nishapur in
    the Persian province of Khorassan, where it was known in very ancient
    times; it is found with limonite filling the cracks and cavities
    in a brecciated porphyritic trachyte. Pieces of the turquoise and
    limonite from here are sometimes cut without removal of the latter,
    and sold as ‘turquoise-matrix,’ when the precious stones are too tiny
    to be worth separate working. It also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> occurs at Serbâl in the Sinai
    Peninsula. Among the more recent localities may be mentioned Los
    Cerillos Mountains, New Mexico; Sierra Nevada, Nevada, where pale blue
    and green stones are found; San Bernardino County, California, where
    again the stones are rather pale; and Arizona, where it occurs in pale
    greenish-blue stones.</p>

  <p>Some of the stones that have been seen are not the true turquoise but
    odontolite, or bone turquoise, which consists of the teeth and bones
    of mastodon or other extinct animals, phosphate of iron being the
    colouring material. These stones may easily be recognized by their
    organic structure, which is clearly visible if viewed with a strong
    lens or under the microscope. Moreover, odontolite invariably contains
    some calcium carbonate, and effervescence takes place if it be touched
    with hydrochloric acid. Turquoise dissolves in hydrochloric acid, but
    without effervescence, and since it contains copper, a fine blue colour
    is imparted to the solution by the addition of ammonia. Odontolite has
    a higher specific gravity, 3·0 to 3·5, but lower hardness, 5 on Mohs’s
    scale.</p>

  <p>Variscite, the hydrated phosphate of aluminium, corresponding to the
    formula AlPO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O, is found in masses resembling a greenish
    turquoise, but it is much softer, being only 4 on Mohs’s scale. The
    specific gravity is 2·55. Round nodular masses of variscite are found
    in Utah.</p>

    <div class="headingc">JADE</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THOUGH not usually accounted precious among European nations or in
    Western civilization in general, jade was held in extraordinary
    esteem by primitive man, and was fashioned by him into ornaments and
    utensils, often of considerable beauty, and even at the present day
    it ranks among the Chinese and Japanese peoples above all precious
    stones; indeed, the Chinese word <i xml:lang="zh">Yu</i> and the Japanese words <i xml:lang="ja">Giyuku</i>
    or <i xml:lang="ja">Tama</i> signify both jade and precious stones in general. According
    to the Chinese, jade is the prototype of all gems, and unites in
    itself the five cardinal virtues—<i xml:lang="zh">Jin</i>, charity; <i xml:lang="zh">Gi</i>, modesty; <i xml:lang="zh">Yu</i>,
    courage; <i xml:lang="zh">Ketsu</i>, justice; and <i xml:lang="zh">Chi</i>, wisdom. When powdered and mixed
    with water, it is supposed to be a powerful remedy for all kinds of
    internal disorders, to strengthen the frame and prevent fatigue, to
    prolong life, and, if taken in sufficient quantity just before death,
    to prevent decomposition.</p>

  <p>Jade is a general term that includes properly two distinct mineral
    species, nephrite or greenstone, and jadeite, which are very similar
    in appearance, both being fibrous and tough in texture, and more or
    less greenish in colour; but it is also applied to other species such
    as saussurite, californite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> bowenite, and plasma, which have somewhat
    similar characters. The word jade is a corruption of the Spanish
    <i xml:lang="es">pietra di hijada</i>, kidney-stone, in allusion to its supposed efficacy
    in diseases of that organ.</p>

  <p>Nephrite or greenstone (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 16) is the commoner of
    the two jades. It is closely allied to the mineral hornblende, a
    silicate of magnesium, iron, and calcium corresponding to the formula
    Ca(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, the magnesia being replaceable by ferrous
    oxide. Microscopic examination shows that the structure consists of
    innumerable independent fibres foliated or matted together, the former
    character giving rise to a slaty and the latter to a horny appearance
    in the stone as seen by the unaided eye. The colour varies from grey
    to leaf- and dark-green, the tint deepening as the relative amount of
    iron in the composition increases, and brown tints result from the
    oxidation of the iron along cracks in the stone. The hardness is 6½ on
    Mohs’s scale; nephrite is therefore about as hard as ordinary glass and
    softer than quartz. When polished, it always acquires a greasy lustre.
    The specific gravity ranges from 2·9 to 3·1. The least and greatest of
    the principal refractive indices are 1·606 and 1·632 respectively, the
    double refraction being biaxial and negative; the coloured fibres also
    display dichroism. All these differential effects are, however, masked
    in the stone because of the irregularity of the aggregation. Nephrite
    is fusible before the blowpipe, but only with difficulty. Its name is
    derived from the Greek word <span xml:lang="el">νεφρός</span>, kidney, the allusion
    being the same as for jade.</p>

  <p>Many of the prehistoric implements found in Mexico and in the Swiss
    Lake Habitations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span> composed of nephrite, but it is uncertain where
    the mineral was obtained. Much of the material used by the Chinese
    at the present time comes from spots near the southern boundary of
    Eastern Turkestan, especially in the valleys of the rivers Karakash and
    Yarkand in the Kwen Lun range of mountains; it is also found farther
    north at the river Kashgar. It occurs in various provinces of China,
    namely, Shensi, Kwei Chau, Kwang Tung, Yunnan, and Manchuria. Gigantic
    waterworn boulders have been found in the Government of Irkutsk, near
    Lake Baikal, in eastern Siberia, the first discovery being made in the
    bed of the Onot stream by the explorer and prospector J. P. Alibert,
    in 1850. A large boulder of this kind, weighing over half a ton (1156
    lb., or 524·5 kg.), is exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the British
    Museum (Natural History). An enormous mass, weighing over 2 tons (4718
    lb., or 2140 kg.), was discovered at Jordansmühl, Silesia, by Dr.
    G. F. Kunz, and is now in the magnificent collection of jade formed
    by Mr. Heber R. Bishop. Beautiful greenstone occurs in New Zealand,
    particularly in the Middle Island. The Maoris have long used it for
    various useful and ornamental purposes, the most common being indicated
    by their general name for the species, <i xml:lang="mi">punamu</i>, axe-stone; <i xml:lang="mi">kawakawa</i>
    is the ordinary green variety, a fine section of which is shown on the
    wall of the Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History),
    while <i xml:lang="mi">inanga</i>, a grey variety, and <i xml:lang="mi">kahurangi</i>, a pale-green and
    translucent variety, are rare and highly prized.</p>

    <p>Jadeite (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 18) is by far the rarer of the two jades,
    and is the choicest gem with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> Chinese. In composition it is a
    silicate of sodium and aluminium with the formula NaAl(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
    corresponding to the lithium mineral spodumene (<a href="#Page_265">p. 265</a>). It has the
    same toughness and greasy lustre as nephrite, but is harder, being
    represented by the symbol 7 on Mohs’s scale, and thus only slightly,
    if at all, softer than quartz. The other characters are also higher;
    the specific gravity is about 3·34, and the least and greatest of the
    principal refractive indices are 1·66 and 1·68, the double refraction
    being biaxial and negative. The colour varies from white to almost
    an emerald green, the latter being especially prized, and often the
    green colour runs in streaks through the white. Jadeite fuses readily
    before the blowpipe to blebby glass, more easily than is the case with
    nephrite.</p>

  <p>The finest jadeite comes from the Mogaung district in Upper Burma,
    where it is found in boulders and also with albite in dykes in a
    dark-green serpentine. The export trade to China, which absorbs
    practically the whole of the output, is exceedingly valuable, and
    realizes nearly as much as the produce of the ruby mines. Jadeite is
    also found in the Shensi and Yunnan provinces of China, and in Tibet.</p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>A few words may be said about the other jade-like minerals. Saussurite,
    which is named after H. B. de Saussure, has resulted from the
    decomposition of a felspar, and is nearly akin to the mineral zoisite.
    It has the customary toughness of structure, and is greenish grey to
    white in colour. Its specific gravity is about 3·2, and hardness 6½ to
    7 on Mohs’s scale. It occurs near Lake Geneva. Bowenite is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span> a green
    serpentine (<a href="#Page_289">p. 289</a>) which is found at Smithfield, Rhode Island, U.S.A.,
    and in New Zealand and Afghanistan. Californite and plasma are compact
    varieties of idocrase (<a href="#Page_275">p. 275</a>) and chalcedony (<a href="#Page_247">p. 247</a>) respectively.
    Verdite is a stone of rich green colour which is found in the form of
    large boulders in the North Kaap River, South Africa; it is composed of
    green mica (fuchsite) and some clayey matter.</p>

  <p>Jade has of recent years been imitated in glass, but the latter is
    recognizable by its vitreous lustre and inferior hardness, and sooner
    or later by its frangibility.</p>

      <div class="headingc">SPODUMENE, IOLITE, BENITOITE</div>
  </div>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Spodumene</span></h3>
  <div class="subhead">(<i>Kunzite</i>, <i>Hiddenite</i>)</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TILL a few years ago scarcely known outside the ranks of mineralogists,
    spodumene suddenly leaped into notice in 1903 upon the discovery of the
    lovely lilac-coloured stones (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 10) at Pala, San Diego
    County, California; they shortly afterwards received the name kunzite
    after the well-known expert in gems, Dr. G. F. Kunz. The stones were
    found here in a pegmatite dyke, and were of all shades, ranging from
    pale pink to deep lilac, and at times as much as 150 carats in weight.
    Paler kunzite occurs with beryl and tourmaline at Coahuila Mountain
    in Riverside County, California, and colourless stones have recently
    come to light in Madagascar. Kunzite is remarkable for its wonderful
    dichroism; the beautiful violet tint that springs out in one direction
    comes with greater surprise because of the uninteresting yellowish
    tints in other directions. Unlike spodumene in general, kunzite is
    phosphorescent under the influence of radium.</p>

  <p>The emerald-green variety (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 11),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span> named hiddenite after
    Mr. W. E. Hidden, who discovered in 1881 the only known occurrence, in
    Alexander County, North Carolina, would no doubt have become popular
    had the supply of material not been so very limited; few stones were
    found, and the variety has never come to light elsewhere. The colour is
    supposed to be due to chromic acid. Hiddenite being also dichroic, the
    tint varies with the direction.</p>

  <p>Spodumene is ordinarily rather a pale yellowish in hue, and, as its
    name (which is derived from <span xml:lang="el">σποδίος</span>, ash-coloured) suggests,
    is not very attractive. Clear, lemon-yellow stones (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate XXIX</a>, Fig. 9)
    are found in Brazil and Madagascar.</p>

  <p>The species is interesting scientifically because it contains the
    rare element lithium; it is a silicate of aluminium and lithium,
    corresponding to the formula LiAl(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The double refraction
    is biaxial in character and positive in sign, the least and greatest
    of the refractive indices being 1·660 and 1·675; the specific gravity
    is 3·185, and hardness 6½ to 7 on Mohs’s scale. Spodumene has an easy
    cleavage, and the cut stones call therefore for careful handling, lest
    they be flawed or fractured. Two faceted stones, a beautiful kunzite
    and a fine hiddenite, weighing 60 and 2½ carats respectively, are
    exhibited in the British Museum (Natural History).</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Iolite</span></h3>

  <p>Known also by various other names—cordierite, dichroite, and
    water-sapphire (<i xml:lang="fr">saphire d’eau</i>)—this species owes its interest
    to the remarkable dichroism characterizing it, the principal
    colours—smoky-blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> and yellowish white—being in such contrast as to
    be obvious to the unaided eye. The stones that are usually worked have
    intrinsically a smoky-blue colour, and are found in waterworn masses
    in the river-gravels of Ceylon, whence is the origin of the name
    water-sapphire. Iolite, from <span xml:lang="el">ἴον</span>, violet, and <span xml:lang="el">λίθος</span>,
    stone, refers to the colour; cordierite is named after Cordier, a
    French geologist, who first studied the crystallography of the species;
    and dichroite, of course, alludes to the most prominent character of
    the species.</p>

  <p>Iolite is a silicate of aluminium and of magnesium and iron
    corresponding to the formula H<sub>2</sub>(Mg,Fe)<sub>4</sub>Al<sub>8</sub>Si<sub>10</sub>O<sub>37</sub>.
    The double refraction is small in amount, biaxial in character, and
    negative in sign, the least and greatest of the refractive indices
    being 1·543 and 1·551; the specific gravity is 2·63, and hardness 7 on
    Mohs’s scale. Iolite, if used, is worked and polished; it is seldom
    faceted. A large worked piece, weighing 177 grams, which was formerly
    in the Hawkins Collection, is exhibited in the British Museum (Natural
    History).</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Benitoite</span></h3>

  <p>The babe among gem-stones, benitoite first saw the light of day a few
    years ago, early in 1907. It occurs with the rare mineral neptunite,
    which was previously known only from Greenland, in narrow veins of
    natrolite in Diablo Range near the head-waters of the San Benito River,
    San Benito County, California. Despite careful search the species has
    not been found except within the original restricted area. To science
    it is interesting both because of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span> its composition, a silico-titanate
    of barium, corresponding to the formula BaTiSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, and because
    its crystals belong to a class of crystalline symmetry which has
    hitherto not been represented among minerals. The double refraction
    is uniaxial, and since the ordinary index of refraction is 1·757 and
    the extraordinary 1·804, it is positive in sign and large in amount,
    namely, 0·047. The stones are characterized by strong dichroism, the
    colour corresponding to the ordinary ray being white, and to the
    extraordinary greenish blue to indigo depending upon the tint of the
    stone. To obtain the best effect the stone must therefore be cut with
    the table-facet parallel to the crystallographic axis. The specific
    gravity is 3·65, and hardness 6½ on Mohs’s scale. When first discovered
    the species was supposed to be sapphire, and many stones were cut and
    sold as such. It is, however, much softer than sapphire, and is readily
    distinguished by its optical characters, since it possesses greater
    double refraction and of differing sign, so that, when tested with the
    refractometer, the shadow-edge corresponding to the lower index of
    refraction remains fixed in the case of benitoite, whereas the contrary
    happens with sapphire. Benitoite also, unlike sapphire, fuses easily
    to a transparent glass. Its blue colour, which is supposed to be due
    to a small amount of free titanic acid present, appears to be stable.
    Several stones as large as 1½ to 2 carats in weight have been found.
    The largest of all, perfectly flawless, weighs just over 7 carats, and
    is remarkable because it is about three times the next largest in point
    of weight; it is the property of Mr. G. Eacret, of San Francisco.</p>

    <div class="headingc">EUCLASE, PHENAKITE, BERYLLONITE</div>
  </div>

  <h3>Euclase</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS species comes near beryl in chemical composition, being a
    silicate of aluminium and beryllium corresponding to the formula
    Be(AlOH)SiO<sub>4</sub>, and closely resembles aquamarine in colour and
    appearance when cut. Owing to the rarity of the mineral good specimens
    command high prices for museum collections, and it is seldom worth
    while cutting it for jewellery. It derives its name from its easy
    cleavage, <span xml:lang="el">εὖ</span> easily, and <span xml:lang="el">κλάσις</span> fracture. The double
    refraction is biaxial in character and positive in sign, the least and
    greatest of the refractive indices being 1·651 and 1·670 respectively;
    the specific gravity is 3·07, and the hardness 7½ on Mohs’s scale.
    The colour is usually a sea-green, but sometimes blue. Euclase occurs
    with topaz at the rich mineral district of Minas Novas, Minas Geraes,
    Brazil, and has also been found in the Ural district, Russia.</p>

  <h3>Phenakite</h3>

  <p>Another beryllium mineral, phenakite owes its name to the frequency
    with which it has been mistaken for quartz, being derived from <span xml:lang="el">φέναξ</span>,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> deceiver. The clear, colourless crystals, somewhat complex in
    form, have at times been cut, but they lack ‘fire,’ and despite their
    brilliant lustre meet with little demand. The composition is a silicate
    of beryllium corresponding to the formula Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The double
    refraction is uniaxial, and since the ordinary, 1·652, is less than
    the extraordinary index, 1·667, it is positive in sign; the specific
    gravity is 2·99, and the hardness is almost equal to that of topaz,
    being about 7½ to 8 on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p>Fine stones have long been known near Ekaterinburg in the Ural
    Mountains, and have recently been discovered in Brazil.</p>

  <h3>Beryllonite</h3>

  <p>As its name suggests, this mineral also contains beryllium, being
    a soda phosphate corresponding to the formula NaBePO<sub>4</sub>. Clear,
    colourless stones, which occur at Stoneham, Maine, U.S.A., have been
    cut, but the lack of ‘fire,’ the easy cleavage, and comparative
    softness, the symbol being 5½ on Mohs’s scale, unfit it for use in
    jewellery. The double refraction is biaxial in character and negative
    in sign, the least and the greatest of the refractive indices being
    1·553 and 1·565 respectively.</p>

  <div class="subhead">(‘<i>Green Garnet</i>’)</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE small green stones which accompany the diamond in South Africa have
    been cut and put on the market as ‘green garnet.’ They are, however,
    in no way connected with garnet, but belong to a mineral species
    called enstatite, which is a silicate of magnesium corresponding to
    the formula MgSiO<sub>3</sub>; the green colour is due to a small amount of
    ferrous oxide which replaces magnesia. The double refraction is biaxial
    in character and positive in sign, the least and greatest of the
    refractive indices being 1·665 and 1·674 respectively; the specific
    gravity ranges from 3·10 to 3·13, and the hardness is only about 5½
    on Mohs’s scale. The dichroism is perceptible, the twin-colours being
    yellowish and green, and, as usual, is more pronounced the deeper the
    colour of the stone. There is also a good cleavage in two different
    directions.</p>

  <p>With increasing percentage amount of iron enstatite passes into
    hypersthene. The colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span> becomes a dark brownish green, and an increase
    takes place in the physical constants, the least and greatest of the
    refractive indices attaining to 1·692 and 1·705 respectively, and
    the specific gravity ranging from 3·4 to 3·5. Hypersthene is never
    sufficiently transparent for faceting, but when spangled with small
    scales of brookite it is sometimes cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>.</p>

  <p>The name enstatite is derived from <span xml:lang="el">ἐνστάτης</span>, an opponent,
    referring to the infusibility of the mineral before the blowpipe, and
    hypersthene comes from <span xml:lang="el">ὑπερσθένος</span>, very tough.</p>

  <p>An altered enstatite, leek-green in colour and with nearly the
    composition of serpentine (<a href="#Page_289">p. 289</a>), has been cut <i xml:lang="fr">en cabochon</i>. It has
    much lower specific gravity, only 2·6, and lower hardness, 3½ to 4 on
    Mohs’s scale. It is named bastite from Baste in the Harz Mountains,
    where it was first discovered.</p>

  <h3>Diopside</h3>

  <p>This species, which is also known as malacolite and alalite, provides
    stones of a leaf-green colour which have occasionally been cut. It
    is a silicate of calcium and magnesium corresponding to the formula
    MgCa(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, but usually contains in place of magnesia some
    ferrous oxide, to which it owes its colour; with increase in the
    percentage amount of iron the colour deepens and the physical constants
    change. The double refraction is large in amount, 0·028, biaxial
    in character, and positive in sign. The least and greatest of the
    refractive indices corresponding to the stones suitable for jewellery
    range about 1·671 and 1·699 respectively, but they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span> may be as high as
    1·732 and 1·750 in the two cases. The specific gravity varies from 3·20
    to 3·38, and the hardness from 5 to 6 on Mohs’s scale. Dichroism is
    noticeable in deep-coloured stones, but is not very marked.</p>

  <p>The name diopside comes from <span xml:lang="el">δίς</span>, double, and <span xml:lang="el">ὄψις</span>,
    appearance, in allusion to the effect resulting from the double
    refraction; malacolite is derived from <span xml:lang="el">μαλακός</span>, soft, because
    the mineral is softer than the felspar associated with it; and alalite
    is named after the principal locality, Ala Valley, Piedmont, Italy.</p>

  <h3>Kyanite</h3>

  <p>Kyanite, also known as disthene, is interesting for two reasons. Its
    structure is so grained in character that the hardness varies in the
    same stone from 5 to 7 on Mohs’s scale; it can therefore be scratched
    by a knife in some directions, but not in others (<a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>). It has the
    same chemical composition as andalusite, both being silicates of
    aluminium corresponding to the formula Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>, but possesses
    very different physical characters, a fact which shows how large
    a share the molecular grouping has in determining the aspect of
    crystallized substances. It is biaxial with small negative double
    refraction, the least and greatest of the refractive indices being
    1·72 and 1·73 respectively; the specific gravity is 3·61. It occurs in
    sky-blue prismatic crystals, whitish at the edges, in schist near St.
    Gothard, Switzerland. It is seldom cut.</p>

  <p>Kyanite is derived from its colour, <span xml:lang="el">κύανος</span> blue, and disthene,
    from its variable hardness, <span xml:lang="el">δίς</span>, twice, and <span xml:lang="el">σθένος</span>,
    strong.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>

  <h3>Andalusite</h3>

  <p>Andalusite bears no resemblance whatever to kyanite, although, as has
    been stated above, the composition of the two species is essentially
    the same. It is usually light bottle-green in colour, and more rarely
    brown and reddish. Its extreme dichroism is its most remarkable
    character, the twin colours being olive-green and red. The reddish
    gleams that are reflected from the interior are in sharp contrast with
    the general colour of the stone, and impart to it a weird effect (<a href="#Plate_XXIX">Plate
    XXIX</a>, Fig. 15). Cut stones are often confused with tourmalines, and
    can, indeed, only be distinguished from the latter with certainty by
    noting on the refractometer the smaller amount of double refraction
    and the difference in its character. The least and greatest of the
    refractive indices are 1·62 and 1·643 respectively, and the double
    refraction, 0·011, about half that of tourmaline, is biaxial and
    negative; the specific gravity is 3·18, and hardness 7½ on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p>Good stones are found at Minas Novas, Minas Geraes, Brazil, and in
    the gem-gravels of Ceylon. It was first known from the province of
    Andalusia, Spain, whence is the origin of its name.</p>

  <h3>Idocrase</h3>

  <div class="subhead">(<i>Vesuvianite</i>, <i>Californite</i>)</div>

  <p>Idocrase, also known as vesuvianite, is occasionally found in the
    form of transparent, leaf-green, and yellowish-brown stones which,
    when cut, may be mistaken for diopside and epidote respectively, but
    are distinguishable from both by the extreme smallness <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>of their
    double refraction. Californite is a compact variety which has all the
    appearances of a jade; its colour is green, or nearly colourless with
    green streaks.</p>

  <p>In composition idocrase is a silicate of aluminium and calcium, the
    precise formula of which is uncertain, but may be—</p>

  <div class="center">(Ca,Mn,Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>[(Al,Fe)(OH,F)]Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.</div>

  <p class="noindent">The double refraction, which is uniaxial in character and negative in
    sign, may be less than 0·001, and never exceeds 0·006, so that it is
    not easily detected with the refractometer, even in sodium light. The
    refractive indices vary enormously in value, from 1·702 to 1·726 for
    the ordinary, and from 1·706 to 1·732 for the extraordinary ray. The
    specific gravity varies from 3·35 to 3·45, and the hardness is about 6½
    on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p>The name idocrase, from <span xml:lang="el">εἴδος</span>, form, and <span xml:lang="el">κρᾶσις</span>,
    mixture, was assigned to the species by Haüy, but his reasons have
    little meaning at the present day. The other names are taken from the
    localities where the species and the variety were first discovered.</p>

  <p>Bright, green crystals come from Russia, and also from Ala Valley,
    Piedmont, and Mount Vesuvius, Italy. Californite is found in large
    masses in Siskiyon and Fresno Counties, California.</p>

  <h3>Epidote</h3>

  <div class="subhead">(<i>Pistacite</i>)</div>

  <p>Epidote often possesses a peculiar shade of yellowish green, similar
    to that of the pistachio-nut—hence the origin of its alternative
    name—which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> unique among minerals, though scarcely pleasing enough
    to recommend it to general taste. Its ready cleavage renders it liable
    to flaws; nevertheless, it is occasionally faceted. The name epidote,
    from <span xml:lang="el">ἐπίδοσις</span>, increase, was given to it by Haüy, but not on
    very precise crystallographical grounds.</p>

  <p>In composition this species is a silicate of calcium and aluminium,
    with some ferric oxide in place of alumina, corresponding to the
    complex formula, Ca<sub>2</sub>(Al,Fe)<sub>2</sub>[(Al,Fe)OH](SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. It
    occurs in monoclinic, prismatic crystals richly endowed with natural
    faces. The colour deepens with increase in the percentage amount of
    iron, and the stones become almost opaque. The double refraction is
    large in amount, 0·031, biaxial in character, and negative in sign.
    The dichroism is conspicuous in transparent stones, the twin-tints
    corresponding to the principal optical directions being green, brown,
    and yellow. The values of the least and greatest of the refractive
    indices given by transparent stones are 1·735 and 1·766 respectively;
    the specific gravity varies from 3·25 to 3·50, and the hardness from 6
    to 7 on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p>Transparent crystals have come from Knappenwand, Untersulzbachtal,
    Salzburg, Austria; Traversella, Piedmont, Italy; and Arendal, Nedenäs,
    Norway. Magnificent, but very dark, crystals were discovered about ten
    years ago on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska.</p>

  <h3>Sphene</h3>

  <div class="subhead">(<i>Titanite</i>)</div>

  <p>The clear, green, yellow, or brownish stones provided by this species
    would be welcomed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> jewellery because of their brilliant and
    almost adamantine lustre, but, unfortunately, they are too soft to
    withstand much wear, the hardness being only 5½ on Mohs’s scale. In
    composition sphene is a silico-titanate of calcium corresponding to
    the formula CaTiSiO<sub>5</sub>, and in this respect comes near the recently
    discovered gem-stone, benitoite. The refractive indices lie outside
    the range of the refractometer, the values of the least and the
    greatest of the refractive indices varying from 1·888 and 1·917 to
    1·914 and 2·053 respectively. It is to this high refraction that it
    owes its brilliant lustre. The double refraction, which is biaxial in
    character and positive in sign, is so large that the apparent doubling
    of the opposite edges of a cut stone when viewed through one of the
    faces is obvious to the unaided eye (cf. <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>). Cut stones have
    additional interest on account of the vivid dichroism displayed, the
    twin-tints, colourless, yellow, and reddish yellow, corresponding to
    the three principal optical directions, being in strong contrast. The
    specific gravity ranges from 3·35 to 3·45. The negative test with the
    refractometer (cf <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>), the softness, and the large amount of double
    refraction suffice to distinguish this species from gem-stones of
    similar appearance.</p>

  <p>The name sphene, from <span xml:lang="el">σφήν</span>, wedge, alludes to the shape of
    the natural crystals. The alternative name is obviously due to the fact
    that the species contains titanium.</p>

  <p>Good stones have come from the St. Gothard district, Switzerland.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>

  <h3>Axinite</h3>

  <p>Called axinite from the shape of its crystals—<span xml:lang="el">ἀξίνη</span>, axe—this
    species supplies small, clear, clove-brown, honey-yellow, and violet
    stones which can be cut for those who care for a stone out of the
    ordinary. The composition is a boro-silicate of aluminium and calcium,
    with varying amounts of iron and manganese, corresponding to the
    formula (Ca,Fe)<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(B.OH)Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>15</sub>. Axinite is interesting on
    account of its strong dichroism, the twin-tints corresponding to the
    principal optical directions being violet, brown, and green. The double
    refraction is biaxial in character and negative in sign, the least and
    greatest of the refractive indices being 1·674 and 1·684; the specific
    gravity is 3·28, and hardness about 6½ to 7, or rather under that of
    quartz.</p>

  <p>The best examples have been found at St. Cristophe, Bourg d’Oisans, in
    the Dauphiné, France. Violet axinite is a novelty that has come within
    recent years from Rosebery, Montagu County, Tasmania.</p>

  <h3>Prehnite</h3>

  <p>This species, which is named after its discoverer, Colonel Prehn, is
    found in nodular, yellow and oil-green stones, of which the latter
    have very occasionally been cut. It is a little soft, the hardness
    being only 6 on Mohs’s scale. The double refraction is large in amount,
    0·033, biaxial in character, and positive in sign, the least and the
    greatest of the refractive indices being 1·616 and 1·649 respectively;
    the specific gravity varies from 2·81 to 2·95. In composition prehnite
    is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> silicate of aluminium and calcium corresponding to the formula
    H<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

  <p>The best material has been found at St. Cristophe, Bourg d’Oisans,
    Dauphiné, France.</p>

  <h3>Apatite</h3>

  <p>This interesting mineral is found occasionally in attractive green,
    blue, or violet stones, but is unfortunately too soft for extensive use
    in jewellery, the hardness being only 5 on Mohs’s scale. In composition
    it is a fluo-chloro-phosphate of calcium, corresponding to the formula
    Ca<sub>4</sub>[Ca(F,Cl)](PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. When pure, it is devoid of colour,
    the tints being due to the presence of small amounts of tinctorial
    agents. The double refraction is uniaxial in character and negative in
    sign, the ordinary index being 1·642 and the extraordinary 1·646; the
    specific gravity varies from 3·17 to 3·23. The dichroism is usually
    feeble, but sometimes is strong; for instance, in the stones from the
    Burma ruby mines (yellow, blue-green). A cut stone might be mistaken
    for tourmaline, but is distinguished by its softness, or, when tested
    on the refractometer, by its inferior double refraction. It received
    its name from <span xml:lang="el">ἀπατάειν</span>, deceive, because it was wrongly
    assigned to at least half a dozen different species in early days.
    Moroxite is a name sometimes given to blue-green apatite.</p>

  <p>Beautiful violet stones are found at Ehrenfriedersdorf, Saxony;
    Schlaggenwald, Bohemia; and Mount Apatite, Auburn, Androscoggin County,
    Maine, U.S.A.; and blue stones come from Ceylon.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

  <h3>Dioptase</h3>

  <p>Though of a pretty, emerald-green colour, dioptase has never been
    found in large enough crystals for gem purposes, and it is, moreover,
    rather soft, the hardness being only 5 on Mohs’s scale, and has an
    easy cleavage. In composition it is a hydrous silicate of copper
    corresponding to the formula CuH<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The double refraction,
    which is large in amount, is uniaxial in character, and positive in
    sign, the ordinary refractive index being 1·667 and the extraordinary
    1·723. Its colour and softness distinguish it from peridot or diopside,
    which have about the same refractivity. The name was assigned to the
    species by Haüy, from <span xml:lang="el">διὰ</span>, through, and <span xml:lang="el">ὄπτομαι</span>, see,
    because the cleavage directions were distinguishable by looking through
    the stone.</p>

  <p>Dioptase has been found near Altyn-Tübe in the Kirghese Steppes, at
    Rezbánya in Hungary, and Copiapo in Chili, and at the mine Mindouli,
    near Comba, in the French Congo.</p>

    <div class="headingc">CASSITERITE, ANATASE, PYRITES, HEMATITE</div>
  </div>

  <h3>Cassiterite</h3>

  <p class="drop-cap">THOUGH usually opaque, this oxide of tin, corresponding to the formula
    SnO<sub>2</sub>, has occasionally, but very rarely, been found in small,
    transparent, yellow and reddish stones suitable for cutting. The lustre
    is adamantine. The refraction is uniaxial in character and positive
    in sign, the ordinary index being 1·997 and extraordinary 2·093. The
    specific gravity is high, ranging from 6·8 to 7·1. The hardness is on
    the whole less than that of quartz, being about 6 to 7 on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <h3>Anatase</h3>

  <p>This mineral, which is one of the three crystallized forms of titanium
    oxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, occurs often in small, brown, transparent stones which
    occasionally find their way into the market. The lustre is adamantine.
    The refraction is uniaxial in character and negative in sign, the
    extraordinary index being 2·493 and ordinary 2·554. The specific
    gravity varies from 3·82 to 3·95, and the hardness is about 5½ to 6 on
    Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

  <h3>Pyrites, Hematite</h3>

  <p>These two metallic minerals were employed in ancient jewellery. The
    former, sulphide of iron, FeS<sub>2</sub>, is brass-yellow in colour, and has
    a specific gravity 5·2, and hardness 6½ on Mohs’s scale. It is found,
    when fresh, in brilliant cubes. The latter, oxide of iron, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
    has a black metallic lustre, but, when powdered, is red in colour—a
    mode of distinguishing it from other minerals of similar appearance.
    Its specific gravity is 5·3, and hardness 6½ on Mohs’s scale. In modern
    times it has been cut in spherical form to imitate black pearls, but
    can easily be recognized by its greater density and hardness. Hematite
    is used for signet stones, often with an intaglio engraving.</p>

    <div class="headingc">OBSIDIAN, MOLDAVITE</div>
  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">TWO forms of natural glass have been employed for ornamental purposes.
    Obsidian results from the solidification without crystallization of
    lava, and corresponds in composition to a granite. The structure
    is seldom clear and transparent, and usually contains inclusions
    or streaks. The colour is in the mass jet-black, but smoky in thin
    fragments, and occasionally greenish. Its property of breaking with a
    keen cutting edge, in the same way as ordinary glass, rendered it of
    extreme utility to primitive man, who was ignorant of the artificial
    substance. The refraction is, of course, single, and the refractive
    index approximates to 1·50. The specific gravity varies from 2·3 to
    2·5. The hardness is 5 on Mohs’s scale, the same as ordinary glass.</p>

  <p>Obsidian is obtained wherever there has been volcanic activity. Vast
    mines of great antiquity exist in the State of Hidalgo, Mexico.</p>

  <p>Moldavite, which differs in no respect from ordinary green
    bottle-glass, is of interest on account of its problematical origin.
    Its occurrence in various parts of Bohemia and Moravia cannot be
    explained as the result of volcanic agency. It may possibly be the
    product of old and forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> glass factories which at one time existed
    on the site. Even meteorites have been suggested as the source. The
    physical characters are the same as those of ordinary glass: refraction
    single, index 1·51; specific gravity 2·50 and hardness 5½ on Mohs’s
    scale. Moldavite also passes under the names of bottle-stone, or
    water-chrysolite. A natural glass of the same character has been found
    in water-worn fragments in Ceylon, and has been sold as peridot, which
    it resembles in colour, but is readily distinguished from it by its
    very different physical properties.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">SPACE will not permit of more than a few words concerning the more
    prominent of the numerous mineral species which are employed for
    ornamental purposes in articles of virtu or in architecture, but which
    for various reasons cannot take rank as gem-stones.</p>

  <p>Fluor, a beautiful mineral which is found in its greatest perfection in
    England, has enjoyed well-deserved popularity when worked into vases
    or other articles. The finest material, deep purple in colour, known
    as ‘Blue John,’ came from Derbyshire, but the supply is now exhausted.
    The crystallized examples, from Durham, Devonshire, and Cornwall, form
    some of the most attractive of museum specimens. The crystals take the
    shape of cubes, often twinned, and have an easy octahedral cleavage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
    The refraction is single, the index being 1·433. Fluor is noted for its
    property of appearing of differing colour by reflected and transmitted
    light, and the phenomenon is in consequence known as fluorescence. The
    specific gravity is 3·18, and the hardness 4 on Mohs’s scale. Owing to
    its low refraction and softness, fluor is not suitable for jewellery.
    Clear colourless material is in demand for particular lenses of
    microscope objectives.</p>

  <p>The lovely blue stone known as lapis lazuli has since the earliest
    times been applied to all kinds of decorative purposes, for mosaic
    and inlaid work and as the material for vases, boxes, and so on, and
    was the original sapphire of the ancients. When ground to powder it
    furnishes a fine blue paint, but it has now been entirely superseded
    for this purpose by an artificial product. Although to the eye so
    homogeneous and uniform in structure, lapis lazuli has been shown
    by microscopic examination to be composed of calcite coloured by
    three blue minerals in varying proportions. All three belong to the
    cubic class of symmetry, and are mainly soda aluminium silicates
    in composition; their hardness varies from 5 to 6 on Mohs’s scale.
    Lazurite, Na<sub>4</sub>(NaS<sub>3</sub>.Al)Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, has specific gravity
    varying from 2·38 to 2·45, and hardness about 5 to 5½; haüynite,
    (Na<sub>2</sub>,Ca)<sub>2</sub>(NaSO<sub>4</sub>,Al)Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, is about the same in
    specific gravity, 2·4 to 2·5, but slightly harder, 5½ to 6; while
    sodalite, Na<sub>4</sub>(AlCl)Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, is the lightest in density,
    2·14 to 2·30, with hardness 5½ to 6, and has a refractive index 1·483.</p>

  <p>By far the oldest mines are in the Badakshan district of Afghanistan,
    a few miles above Firgamu in the valley of the Kokcha, a branch of
    the Oxus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span> where ruby and spinel are found. It is also found at the
    southern end of Lake Baikal, Siberia, and in the Chilian Andes.</p>

  <p>Sodalite occurs in beautiful blue masses at Dungannon, Hastings County,
    Ontario, Canada, and at Litchfield, Maine, U.S.A. They make excellent
    polished stones.</p>

  <p>Violane, a massive, dark violet-blue diopside from San Marcel,
    Piedmont, Italy, also makes a handsome polished stone.</p>

  <p>Rhodonite, silicate of manganese, MnSiO<sub>3</sub>, possesses a fine red
    colour, and makes an attractive stone when cut and polished. It has
    very slight biaxial double refraction, the refractivity being about
    1·73; the specific gravity is 3·6, and hardness 6. It is found in large
    masses near Ekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains, and is quarried as an
    ornamental stone.</p>

  <p>Both the copper carbonates, azurite or chessylite, and malachite, make
    effective polished stones. The latter is also worked into various
    ornamental objects; it occurs in fibrous masses, the grained character
    of which look well in the polished section. Its colour is a bright
    green, to which it owes its name, from <span xml:lang="el">μαλακή</span>, mallows. Its
    composition is represented by the formula CuCO<sub>3</sub>.Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and it
    is the more stable form, since azurite is frequently found altered to
    it. It has biaxial double refraction, and the indices are about 1·88;
    the specific gravity is 4·01, and hardness about 3½ to 4 on Mohs’s
    scale. It is found in large masses at the copper mines of Nizhni
    Tagilsk in the Ural Mountains, where it is mined as an ornamental
    stone; it also accompanies the copper ores in many parts of the world,
    for instance Cuba,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> Chili, and Australia. Azurite, so called on account
    of its beautiful blue colour, is rarer, but, unlike malachite, is
    generally in the form of crystals. Beautiful specimens have come from
    Chessy, near Lyons, France, and Bisbee, Arizona, U.S.A. The composition
    corresponds to the formula 2CuCO<sub>3</sub>, Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The specific gravity
    is 3·80, and hardness about 3½ to 4.</p>

  <p>Chrysocolla occurs in blue and bluish-green earthy masses, with
    an enamel-like texture, which in some instances can be worked and
    polished. Being the result of the decomposition of copper ores, it
    varies considerably in hardness, ranging from 2 to 4 on Mohs’s scale.
    Its composition approaches to the formula CuSiO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, but it
    invariably contains impurities. It is very light, the density being
    only about 2·2.</p>

  <p>Steatite, or soapstone, is a massive foliated silicate of magnesium
    corresponding to the formula H<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, which is one of
    the softest of mineral substances, representing the degree 1 on Mohs’s
    scale, but in massive pieces is harder owing to the intermixture of
    other substances with it. It has a peculiar greasy feeling to the
    touch, due to its softness. The specific gravity is about 2·75. The
    Chinese carve images out of the yellowish and brownish pieces.</p>

  <p>Meerschaum, a silicate of magnesium corresponding to the formula
    H<sub>4</sub>Mg<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, is familiar to every smoker as a material for
    pipe-bowls. It is very light, the specific gravity being only 2·0, and
    soft, the hardness being about 2 to 2½ on Mohs’s scale. When found,
    it is pure white in colour, and answers to its name, a German word
    signifying sea-foam. It comes from Asia Minor.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

  <p>Serpentine has been largely used for decorative purposes, as well
    as for cameos and intaglios, and formed most of the famous ‘verde
    antique.’ Being the result of the decomposition of other silicates
    it varies enormously in appearance and characters, but the most
    attractive stones are a rich oil-green in colour and resemble jade. The
    composition approximates to the formula H<sub>4</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, but it
    invariably contains other elements. The hardness varies from 2½ to 4
    on Mohs’s scale, according to the minerals contained in the stone; the
    specific gravity is about 2·60 and the refractivity 1·570.</p>

  <p>The beautiful rose-red stone, thulite, makes a handsome decorative
    stone. It has nearly the same composition as epidote (<a href="#Page_275">p. 275</a>), and like
    it has strong dichroism, the principal colours being yellow, light
    rose, and deep rose. The colour is due to manganese. Its refractive
    index is about 1·70, specific gravity 3·12, and hardness 6 to 6½ on
    Mohs’s scale; it possesses an easy cleavage. Fine specimens come from
    Telemark, Norway, and it is therefore called after the old name for
    Norway, Thule.</p>

  <p>Marble is a massive calcite, carbonate of lime, with the formula
    CaCO<sub>3</sub>. When pure it is white, but it is usually streaked with other
    substances which impart a pleasing variety to its appearance. It is
    always readily recognized by the immediate effervescence set up when
    touched with a drop of acid. Calcite is highly doubly refractive (cf.
    <a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>), the extraordinary index being 1·486, and ordinary 1·658, a
    difference of 0·172; the specific gravity is 2·71, and hardness 3 on
    Mohs’s scale. Lumachelle, or fire-marble, is a limestone containing
    shells from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span> which a brilliant, fire-like chatoyancy is emitted
    when light is reflected at the proper angle. It sometimes resembles
    opal-matrix, but is easily distinguished by its lower hardness and by
    its effervescent action with acid. Choice specimens come from Bleiberg
    in Carinthia, and from Astrakhan.</p>

  <p>Apophyllite has not many characters to commend it, being at the best
    faintly pinkish in colour, and always imperfectly transparent. It is
    a hydrous silicate of potassium and calcium with the complex formula
    (H,K)<sub>2</sub>Ca(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O. Its refractivity is about 1·535,
    specific gravity 2·5, and hardness 4½ on Mohs’s scale; it possesses
    an easy cleavage. It occurs in the form of tetragonal crystals at
    Andreasberg in the Harz Mountains, and in the Syhadree Mountains,
    Bombay, India.</p>

  <p class="drop-cap">ALTHOUGH none of the substances considered in this chapter come within
    the strict definition of a stone, since they are directly the result of
    living agency, yet pearl at least cannot be denied the title of a gem.
    Both pearl and coral contain calcium carbonate in one or other of its
    crystallized forms, and both are gathered from the sea; but otherwise
    they have nothing in common. Amber is of vegetable origin, and is a
    very different substance.</p>

  <h3>Pearl</h3>

  <p>From that unrecorded day when some scantily clothed savage seeking for
    succulent food opened an oyster and found to his astonishment within
    its shell a delicate silvery pellet that shimmered in the light of a
    tropical sun, down to the present day, without intermission, pearl has
    held a place all its own in the rank of jewels. Though it be lacking in
    durability, its beauty cannot be disputed, and large examples,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span> perfect
    in form and lustre, are sufficiently rare to tax the deepest purse.</p>

  <p>The substance composing the pearl is identical with the iridescent
    lining—mother-o’-pearl or nacre, as it is termed—of the shell.
    Tortured by the intrusion of some living thing, a boring parasite,
    a worm, or a small fish, or of a grain of sand or other inorganic
    substance, and without means to free itself, the mollusc perforce
    neutralizes the irritant matter by converting it into an object of
    beauty that eventually finds its way into some jewellery cabinet. Built
    up in a haphazard manner and not confined by the inexorable laws of
    intermolecular action, a pearl may assume any and every variety of
    shape from the regular to the fantastic. It may be truly spherical,
    egg- or pear-shaped—pear-drops or pear-eyes, as they are termed—or it
    may be quite irregular—the so-called baroque or barrok pearls. The
    first is the most prized, but a well-shaped drop-pearl is in great
    demand for pendants or ear-rings. The colour is ordinarily white, or
    faintly tinged yellowish or bluish, and somewhat rarely, salmon-pink,
    reddish, or blackish grey. Perfect black pearls are valuable, but not
    as costly as the finest of the white. Though not transparent, pearl is
    to a varying extent translucent, and its characteristic lustre—‘orient’
    in the language of jewellery—is due to the same kind of interaction
    of light reflected from different layers that has been remarked upon
    in the case of opal and certain other stones. The translucency varies
    in degree, and some jewellers speak of the ‘water’ of pearls just as
    in the case of diamonds. If a pearl be sliced across the middle and
    the section be examined under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span> microscope, it will be seen that
    the structure consists of concentric shells and resembles that of an
    onion. These shells are alternately composed of calcium carbonate in
    its crystallized form, aragonite, and of a horny organic matter known
    as conchiolin, and they evidently represent the result of intermittent
    growth. Because of their composite character, pearls have a specific
    gravity ranging from 2·65 to 2·69–2·84–2·89 in the case of pink
    pearls—which is appreciably less than that of aragonite, 2·94: the
    hardness is about the same, namely, 3½ to 4 on Mohs’s scale. That the
    arrangement of the mineral layers is approximately parallel is evinced
    by the distinctness of the shadow-edges shown on examination with the
    refractometer. Pearls require very careful handling, both because they
    are comparatively soft and therefore apt to be scratched, and because
    they are chemically affected by acids, and even by the perspiration
    from the skin. Acids attack only the calcium carbonate, not the
    organic matter; the well-known story therefore of Cleopatra dissolving
    a valuable pearl in vinegar, which is moreover, too weak an acid to
    effect the solution quickly, must not be accepted too literally.
    Pearls are not cut like stones, and therefore as soon as the precious
    bloom has once gone, nothing can be done to revive it. Attempts are
    sometimes made in the case of valuable pearls to remove the dull skin
    and lay bare another iridescent layer underneath, but the operation is
    exceedingly delicate. Even with the best of care pearls must in process
    of time perish owing to the decay of the organic constituent. Pearls
    that have been discovered in ancient tombs crumbled to dust at a touch,
    and those formerly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> ancient rings have vanished or only remain as
    a brown powder, while the garnets or other stones set with them are
    little the worse for the centuries that have passed by.</p>

  <p>The largest known pearl was at one time in the famous collection
    belonging to the banker, Henry Philip Hope. Cylindrical in form, with
    a slight swelling at one end, it measures 50 mm. (2 inches) in length,
    and 115 mm. (4½ inches) in circumference about the thicker, and 83
    mm. (3¼ inches) about the thinner end, and weighs 454 carats. About
    three-quarters of it is white in colour with a fine ‘orient,’ and the
    remainder is bronze in tint. It is valued at upwards of £12,000. A
    large pearl, 300 carats in weight, is in the imperial crown of the
    Emperor of Austria, and another, pear-shaped, is in the possession of
    the Shah of Persia. A beautiful white India pearl, a perfect sphere in
    shape, and 28 carats in weight, is in the Museum of Zosima in Moscow;
    it is known as ‘La Pellegrina.’ The ‘Great Southern Cross,’ which
    consists of nine large pearls naturally joined together in the shape of
    a cross, was discovered in an oyster fished up in 1886 off the beds of
    Western Australia. The collection of jewels in the famous Green Vaults
    at Dresden contains a number of pearls of curious shapes.</p>

  <p>Large pearls are sold separately, while the small pearls known as
    ‘seed’ pearls come into the market bored and strung on silk in
    ‘bunches.’ The unit of weight is the pearl grain, which is a quarter
    of a carat, and the rate of price depends on the square of the weight
    in grains. The rate per unit or base varies from 6d. to 50s. according
    to the shape and quality of the pearl. Spherical pearls command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> the
    best prices, next the pearl-drops, and lastly the buttons; but whatever
    the shape, it is imperative that the pearl have ‘orient,’ without which
    it is valueless. The cheaper grades of pearls are sold by the carat.</p>

  <div class="figcenter w600">
    <div class="captionp mb1" id="Plate_XXX"><i>PLATE XXX</i></div>

    <div class="caption">NATIVES DRILLING PEARLS</div>
  </div>

  <p>For use in necklaces and pendants pearls are bored with a steel drill,
    and threaded with silk, an easy operation on account of their softness.
    They harmonize well with diamonds. Small pearls are often set as a
    frame to large coloured stones, to which they form an admirable foil.
    Pearls set in rings or anywhere where the upper half alone would show
    are generally sawn in halves; ‘button’ pearls find an extensive use in
    modern rings.</p>

  <p>Any mollusc, whether of the bi-valve or the uni-valve type, which
    possesses a nacreous shell, has the power of producing pearls,
    but only two, the pearl-oyster, <i>Meleagrina margaritifera</i>, and
    the pearl-mussel, <i>Unio margarifer</i>, repay the cost of systematic
    fishing. The outside of the shell is formed of the horny matter called
    conchiolin; while the inside is composed of two coats, of which
    the outer consists of alternate layers of conchiolin and calcium
    carbonate in its crystallized form, calcite, and the inner of the same
    organic matter, but with calcium carbonate in its other crystallized
    form, aragonite. The latter coat forms the nacreous lining known as
    mother-o’-pearl, which is identical in consistency with pearl, but
    somewhat more transparent. The iridescence of mother-o’-pearl is due
    not only to the fact that it is composed of a succession of thin
    translucent layers, but also to the fact that these layers overlap
    like slates on a house, and form a series of fine parallel lines on
    the surface; diffraction <span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>therefore as well as interference of light
    takes place, and a similar diffraction phenomenon is displayed even
    by a cast of the inside of the shell. The animal has the property of
    secreting calcium carbonate, which it absorbs from the sea-water, in
    both its crystallized conditions as well as conchiolin. At the outer
    rim it secretes conchiolin, further in calcite, and at the very inside
    aragonite. The shape and appearance of a pearl therefore depend on
    the position in which the intruding substance is situated within the
    shell. The most perfect pearl has been in intermittent motion in the
    interior of the mollusc, and has received successive coats according
    to the position in which it happened to be. A parasite that bores
    into the shell is walled up at the point of entrance, and a wart- or
    blister-pearl results. The thinner the successive coats the finer
    the lustre. Pearls have even been discovered embedded in the animal
    itself. The number of pearls found in a shell depends on the number of
    times the living host was compelled to seal up some irritant object,
    and may vary from one up to the eighty-seven which are said to have
    been found in an Indian oyster. That an oyster thus distinguished has
    not led a happy existence is testified by the distorted shape of its
    shell, a clue that guides the pearl-fishers in their search. Moreover,
    pearl-oysters never have thick nacreous shells, and on the other hand
    molluscs with fine mother-o’-pearl seldom contain pearls.</p>

  <p>Beautiful white and silvery pearls are found in a small oyster that
    lives at a depth of 6 to 13 fathoms (11–24 m.) in the Gulf of Manaar,
    off the coast of Ceylon. About seven-eighths, however, of the pearls
    that come into the market are obtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span> from a larger oyster which
    has its home on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. These famous
    fisheries have been known since very early times. The pearls found
    here are more yellowish than those from Ceylon, but are nevertheless
    of excellent quality. The pearl fisheries off the north-west coast of
    Western Australia and off Venezuela are also not unimportant, and fine
    black pearls have been supplied by molluscs from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Chinese have long made a practice of introducing into the shell of
    a pearl-oyster little tin images of Buddha in order that they may be
    coated with the nacreous secretion. The Japanese have during recent
    years made quite an industry of stimulating the efforts of the mollusc
    by cementing small pieces of mother-o’-pearl to the interior surface
    of the shell (<a href="#Plate_XXXII">Plate XXXII</a>, Fig. 1); these ‘culture’ pearls, as they
    are termed, are recognizable by examination of the back. About a year
    has to elapse before a coating of a tenth of a millimetre is formed,
    and another two years must pass before the thickness is doubled. After
    removal the piece of mother-o’-pearl, which is now coated with several
    nacreous layers, is cemented to a piece of ordinary mother-o’-pearl,
    and the lower portion is ground to the usual symmetrical shape (<a href="#Plate_XXXII">Plate
    XXXII</a>, Fig. 2). Blister pearls are often similarly treated. In both
    cases, however, the ‘orient’ is deficient in quality.</p>

  <p>The finest mother-o’-pearl is supplied by a mollusc found in the sea
    near the islands lying between Borneo and the Philippines, and fine
    material is found at Shark Bay and off Thursday Island.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span></p>

  <h3>Coral</h3>

  <p>Coral ranks far below pearl and meets with but limited appreciation.
    It is common enough in warm seas, but the only kind which finds its
    way into jewellery is the rose or red-coloured coral—the noble coral,
    <i>Corallium nobile</i> or <i xml:lang="la">rubrum</i>. It consists of the axial skeleton of
    the coral polyp, and is built up of hollow tubes fitting one within
    the other. The composition is mainly calcium carbonate with a little
    magnesium carbonate and a small amount of organic matter. The former
    of the mineral substances is in the form of calcite, and the crystals
    are arranged in fibrous form radiating at right angles to the axis of
    the coral. The specific gravity varies from 2·6 to 2·7, being slightly
    under that of calcite, and the hardness is somewhat greater, being
    about 3¾ on Mohs’s scale.</p>

  <p>The best red coral is found in the Mediterranean Sea off Algiers and
    Tunis in Africa, and Sicily and the Calabrian Coast of Italy. The
    industry of shaping and fashioning the coral is carried on almost
    entirely in Italy. Coral is usually cut into beads, either round or
    egg-shaped, and used for necklaces, rosaries, and bracelets. The best
    quality fetches from 20s. to 30s. per carat.</p>

  <h3>Amber</h3>

  <p>This fossil resin, yellow and brownish-yellow in tint, finds an
    extensive use as the material for mouthpieces of pipes, cigar and
    cigarette-holders, umbrella-handles, and so on, and is even locally
    cut for jewellery, although its extreme softness, its hardness <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>being
    only 2½ on Mohs’s scale, quite unfits it for such a purpose. It is
    only slightly denser than water, the specific gravity being about
    1·10. Since the structure is amorphous the refraction is single, the
    index being about 1·540. Amber, being a very bad conductor of heat, is
    perceptibly warm to the touch. Its property of becoming electrified by
    friction attracted early attention, and from the Greek name for it,
    <span xml:lang="el">ἤλεκτρον</span>, is derived our word electricity.</p>

  <p>Amber is washed up by the sea off the coasts of Sicily and Prussia,
    and of Norfolk and Suffolk in England. The finest examples, which are
    picked up off the shore of Catania in Sicily, are distinguished by a
    fine bluish fluorescence, resembling that seen in lubricating oil; such
    pieces command good prices.</p>

  <p>A recent resin, pale yellow in colour, known as kauri-gum, is found in
    New Zealand, where it is highly valued.</p>

      Methylene iodide must be heated almost to boiling-point to
      enable it to absorb sufficient sulphur; but caution must be exercised
      in the operation to prevent the liquid boiling over and catching fire,
      the resulting fumes being far from pleasant. It is advisable to verify
      by actual observation that the liquid is refractive enough not to show
      any shadow-edge in the field of view of the refractometer.
